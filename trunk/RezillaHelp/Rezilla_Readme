Rezilla
=======

Rezilla is a resource forks editor for the Macintosh. 
This is version 1.0.8.

features and just fixes a few bugs:

    ¥ better support of hex value string formats in popups
    ¥ fixed a wrong offset in the items of flag popups used by
  BORV/WORV/LORV template tags (bugs 1415340 and 1415342)
    ¥ fixed crashing bug occuring in certain circumstances with templates 
  using CASE tags (bugs 1241475 and 1412133).
    ¥ additional format to display the four values of a RECT tag in
  templates: top left bottom right or top left width height. This can be
  selected via the Preferences.

The Rezilla project is a work in progress. This release is the second final
release (previous versions were in beta testing stage) and is also the last
of the 1.0.x series: next version will be 1.1 and will implement a plugin
architecture in order to support third party editors. As usual, it comes
without any warranty (see licence terms). That said, it has been thoroughly
tested and has proven quite stable and reliable.
