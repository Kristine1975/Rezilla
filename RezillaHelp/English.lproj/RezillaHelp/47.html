<H2>AppleScript support</H2><P>A complete AppleScript support has been introduced in <B>Rezilla</B> starting 
from version 1.0.5b. AppleScript is Apple's scripting language for 
automating operations and controlling other applications. <B>Rezilla</B> 
defines a set of commands and classes which make it easy to automatically
manipulate the resource documents: they let you simulate almost all the
actions defined by the application, that is to say all the commands defined
in the various menus.<P>All the commands explained in this tutorial have to be addressed to the 
application using the usual <I>tell</I> statements, like for instance:
<PRE>
	tell application "Rezilla"
		-- here come the commands...
	end tell
</PRE><P>In the remaining of this document, we will not repeat in each example the 
complete <I>tell</I> block for the sake of legibility but it is always 
implied.<P>
