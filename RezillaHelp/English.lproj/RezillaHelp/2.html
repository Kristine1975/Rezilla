<H2>Introduction</H2>
Macintosh files traditionally have two forks called respectively  the  data
fork and the resource fork. Originally resources were always stored in the 
resource fork (sounds logical, doesn't it?). Since the advent  of  system  OSX,  it  is  now
possible to store resources in the data fork of a file.  Rezilla  lets  you
edit, create, modify, duplicate, remove resources contained in any fork, copy, cut 
and paste them from a resource map to the other, drag and drop resources etc. 
Resource maps can also be exported in text, HTML or XML formats. Rezilla 
can also compare two resource maps.<P>The Rezilla project is meant as an extensible and collaborative project:
<UL>
	<LI> <I>extensible</I> means that it will support a plugin  architecture
to allow for specific external editors to be added for any particular  type
of resource
	<LI> <I>collaborative</I> means that all programmers who wish to collaborate
and submit code contributions are welcome.
