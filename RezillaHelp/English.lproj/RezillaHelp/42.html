<H2>Resource Pickers</H2><P>Since version 1.1, Rezilla introduced resource <B>pickers</B>: a picker is
a special window in which all the resources belonging to a particular type
are displayed graphically. The idea about pickers is to give a preview of
the content of a resource.<P>How the resources are displayed in a picker window depends on their type.
For instance, a resource picker for the 'icns' type displays the thumbnail
(128x128 pixels icon) contained in this kind of resources. A resource
picker for 'TEXT' resources displays the beginning of the text, very much
like what the Navigation Services do when you navigate to open a file. The
ID of the resource is always displayed.<P>The following image shows a picker window for the 'icns' type:
<P><IMG SRC="../../Images/rzil_icnspicker.gif" ALT="Picker Window" ALIGN=bottom></P><P>There is not necessarily a picker for any resource type. Pickers make sense
only for resources which can be somehow "visualized" (text, icons, images,
patterns, cursors, menus, etc.).<P>A resource picker for a particular type is opened simply by double-clicking
on the type item in the resource map documents.<P>When a picker window is opened, one can select a resource with a single
click. A selected resource is surrounded by a red frame: a single click
will unselect it. If it is selected, the usual commands of the <I>Resources</I> menu are enabled so that one can edit the resource, duplicate
or remove it. A double-click on a selected resource is equivalent to the
<I>Edit</I> command of the <I>Resources</I> menu.<P>Currently, Rezilla defines pickers for the following types:
<I>'TEXT', 'MENU', 'STR#', 'MBAR', 'RID#', 'Mcmd', 'RidL', 'cicn', 'ICON', 'SICN', 'icns', 'PICT', 'PAT ', 'ppat', 'PAT#', 'ICN#', 'icl4', 'icl8', 'icm#', 'icm4', 'icm8', 'ics#', 'ics4', 'ics8', 'CURS', 'crsr'</I><P>
