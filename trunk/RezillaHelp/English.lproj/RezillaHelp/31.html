<H2><A NAME="M30"></A>Plugins (external editors)</H2><P>Since version 1.1, Rezilla supports the addition of third party editors
known as <I>plugins</I>. A plugin is a kind of extension which adds new
editing capacities to Rezilla. For instance, there could be a plugin
providing a nice user interface for 'WIND' resources so that the window
resources can be easily viewed and manipulated: Rezilla already has a
template to edit 'WIND' resources but a plugin could add a graphical
interface. Rezilla provides a SDK (Software Development Kit) to allow
developers and software publishers to write this kind of plugins.<P><H4><A NAME="M31"></A>Description</H4><P><P> Plugins can support several resource types. Version 1.1 of
Rezilla comes with a plugin which lets you display and manipulate image
resources. It supports the following image formats:
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I> JPEG, TIFF, GIF, PNG, BMP.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><P> Plugins can be added or removed. Controlling the plugins list can be done 
very easily in the Finder as shown on the image below:
<P><IMG SRC="../../Images/rzil_pluginsfinder.gif " ALT="Editing plugins from the Finder" ALIGN=bottom></P>
<UL>
	<LI> select Rezilla in the Finder<P>	<LI> select the <I>Get Info</I> command in the File menu (or press command-I)<P>	<LI> in the <I>Get Info</I> window, there is a section named <I>Plug-ins</I> which can be opened with a disclosure triangle and displays a list of
the plugins contained in Rezilla<P>	<LI> the <I>Add</I> and <I>Remove</I> buttons located under this list let
you install a new plugin or uninstall an existing one respectively. Each 
plugin has a checkbox: uncheck it when you want to disable a plugin 
temporarily rather than removing it entirely
</UL><P><P> When Rezilla is launched, it looks inside all the plugins to detect 
which type(s) each of them is able to edit. This means that if you add or 
remove a plugin, you must quit Rezilla and relaunch it to take the 
modifications into account.<P><P> Editing a resource using an editor defined in a plugin is done
automatically by Rezilla when one uses the <I>Edit</I> command: the
application will first look for an internal editor corresponding to the
type of the resource you want to edit; if no such editor is found, then it
looks for a plugin able to edit it; if no plugin is available, Rezilla will
attempt to use the Template editor and, in case of failure, it will invoke
the hexadecimal editor as a last resort.<P>One can also invoke directly a plugin with the <I>Edit with Plugin</I>
command found in the <I>Resources</I> menu, as shown in the image below:
this command by-passes the search of an internal editor. The equivalent
keyboard shortcut is option-control-command-E (press E while maintaining
the option, control and command keys down).
<P><IMG SRC="../../Images/rzil_resourcemenu.gif" ALT="The Resources menu" ALIGN=bottom></P><P>Developers interested in creating a plugin for Rezilla should read the 
section <I>Writing a Plugin for Rezilla</I>.<P><H4><A NAME="M32"></A>Plugins information</H4><P>The <I>Plugins...</I> command located in the <I>File</I> menu displays a
dialog window containing two panels which can be selected using the
corresponding thumbnails:
<UL>
	<LI> the <I>Plugin Info</I> panel
	<LI> the <I>Plugin Order</I> panel
</UL><P>The <I>Plugin Info</I> panel (see image below) gives basic information
about the plugins: type, creator, version, supported resource types, etc.
All the plugins detected by Rezilla are listed in the popup menu.
<P><IMG SRC="../../Images/rzil_plugininfo.gif" ALT="The Plugin Info panel" ALIGN=bottom></P><P>The <I>Plugin Order</I> panel (see image below) lets you specify, type by
type, an order among plugins: in the case where several plugins support the
same resource type, Rezilla will choose, by default, the first one it
finds: this panel lets you modify this order. For each resource type, the
table in the <I>Plugin Order</I> panel gives a list of the plugins sorted
by order of preference. You can drag the items of this table with the mouse
in order to rearrange the order and Rezilla will always choose the first in
the list. All the supported types are listed in the popup menu located
above the table.
