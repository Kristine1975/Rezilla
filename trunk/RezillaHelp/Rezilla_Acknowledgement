Rezilla acknowledgement
-----------------------

*** Rezilla's text editing capacity is based on the WASTE library:

WasteLib 2.0 is ©1998-2002 by Marco Piovanelli
	"You are free to develop, use and distribute to end users binaries
	built using the WASTE 2.0 static libraries, at no cost.  Moreover, you
	are free to use and distribute to end users the WASTELib shared
	library, as included in the standard distribution, at no cost.  All
	WASTE-using applications must include the following credit line in
	their about box and/or documentation:
		WASTE Text Engine © 1993-2004 Marco Piovanelli
	Use of source code in freeware applications is free."


*** Rezilla's icon editing capacity is based on PowerPlant's ancient bitmap
editor sample code. This pre-Carbon code has been widely modified in order
to make it both Carbon savvy and OS X savvy, to adapt it to the Rezilla
classes, and to add new 'SICN', 'PAT#', and 'icns' types editors.


*** Version 1.1 of Rezilla contains many improvements contributed by ZPedro 
(many thanks). They are clearly indicated in the source code.
