<H2>Plugins (external editors)</H2><P>Since version 1.1, Rezilla supports the addition of third party editors
known as <I>plugins</I>. A plugin is a kind of extension which adds new
editing capacities to Rezilla. For instance, there could be a plugin
providing a nice user interface for 'WIND' resources so that the window
resources can be easily viewed and manipulated: Rezilla already has a
template to edit 'WIND' resources but a plugin could add a graphical
interface. Rezilla provides a SDK (Software Development Kit) to allow
developers and software publishers to write this kind of plugins.<P><P> Plugins can support several resource types. Version 1.1 of
Rezilla comes with a plugin which lets you display and manipulate image
resources. It supports the following image formats:
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I> JPEG, TIFF, GIF, PNG, BMP.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><P> Plugins can be added or removed. Controlling the plugins list can be done 
very easily in the Finder as shown on the image below:

<UL>
	<LI> select Rezilla in the Finder<P>	<LI> select the <I>Get Info</I> command in the File menu (or press command-I)<P>	<LI> in the <I>Get Info</I> window, there is a section named <I>Plug-ins</I> which can be opened with a disclosure triangle and displays a list of
the plugins contained in Rezilla<P>	<LI> the <I>Add</I> and <I>Remove</I> buttons located under this list let
you install a new plugin or uninstall an existing one respectively. Each 
plugin has a checkbox: uncheck it when you want to disable a plugin 
temporarily rather than removing it entirely
</UL><P><P> When Rezilla is launched, it looks inside all the plugins to detect 
which type(s) each of them is able to edit. This means that if you add or 
remove a plugin, you must quit Rezilla and relaunch it to take the 
modifications into account.<P><P> Editing a resource using an editor defined in a plugin is done
automatically by Rezilla when one uses the <I>Edit</I> command: the
application will first look for an internal editor corresponding to the
type of the resource you want to edit; if no such editor is found, then it
looks for a plugin able to edit it; if no plugin is available, Rezilla will
attempt to use the Template editor and, in case of failure, it will invoke
the hexadecimal editor as a last resort.<P>One can also invoke directly a plugin with the <I>Edit with Plugin</I>
command found in the <I>Resources</I> menu, as shown in the image below:
this command by-passes the search of an internal editor. The equivalent
keyboard shortcut is option-control-command-E (press E while maintaining
the option, control and command keys down).

section <I>Writing a Plugin for Rezilla</I>.<P>
