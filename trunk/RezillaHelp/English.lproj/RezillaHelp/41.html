<H3>Misc panel</H3>
<P> In the <I>Misc</I> panel, one can use the <I>Set type and creator
when closing</I> preference to specify a type and signature to attribute to
a resource file after it has been edited by Rezilla. The default values are
<I>rsrc</I> and <I>Rzil</I> respectively. This is a preference
one must be careful with because certain files, like application files,
already have a specific creator which should not be modified. There is an
additional checkbox called <I>Only files with .rsrc extension</I> which
limits this functionality to files bearing an <I>.rsrc</I> extension.
<P> The <I>Use Rezilla's signature for new maps</I> preference let's you
decide if Rezilla should give its signature to newly created resource
files. If they have this signature, they will be automatically opened by
Rezilla when double-clicked.<P>
