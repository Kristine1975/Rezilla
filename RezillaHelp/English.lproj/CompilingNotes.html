<B>Rezilla</B>, resource forks editor for the Macintosh, is an <I>Open
Source</I> project. It means that, though usually distributed to the users
as an application ready to run under the MacOSX system, its source code is
also available: it is currently hosted on the
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rezilla">SourceForge site.</A> 
<P> This file gives detailed instructions to help compiling the binary from
sources. It corresponds to version 1.1 of Rezilla.

</UL><P><H2><A NAME="M1"></A>Compiling Rezilla from source</H2><P>The <I>Download</I> section above explains where one can find Rezilla's
source code distribution (see
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=83267">here</A> for 
instance).<P><B>Rezilla</B> is written in C++. It is built using 
<A HREF="www.metrowerks.com"> Metrowerks CodeWarrior</A> and relies on the
<B>PowerPlant</B> design framework which is part of the Mac version 
of <B>CodeWarrior</B>.<P>A CodeWarrior project file is provided together with Rezilla's source code:
it has been created with CodeWarrior Pro 9. The corresponding version of
PowerPlant is 2.2.2.<P>Rezilla's hexadecimal editing capacity is based on the <B>WASTE</B> text engine.
You will need to link against the WASTE library in order to compile
Rezilla. This library can be found in various places on the Internet (see
on its <A HREF="http://www.merzwaren.com/waste/"> home page</A> or on the
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WASTE_text_engine"> Wikipedia</A>). It
is also part of the CodeWarrior Pro distribution, so, if you have
CodeWarrior Pro, you certainly have a WASTE distribution: inside
CodeWarrior's hierarchy, it is usually found in
<I>/CodeWarrior/MacOS Support/(Third Party Support)/WASTE Distribution</I>.
Currently, Rezilla uses version 2.1b1 of the WASTE library.<P>Starting with version 1.0.7, the source distribution of Rezilla also
provides <B>XCode</B> project files for those who would prefer using
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com"> Apple's Developer Tools</A> rather 
than CodeWarrior. There are two project files: <I>Rezilla.xcode</I> for
XCode 1.5 and <I>Rezilla.xcodeproj</I> for XCode 2.0 or greater.<P>In any case, whether you use CodeWarrior or XCode, you will need the
PowerPlant framework if you want to build Rezilla from source. Since 
January 2006, <B>PowerPlant</B> has become an Open Source project; 
it is available on the SourceForge site at the following address: 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/open-powerplant">http://sourceforge.net/projects/open-powerplant</A>.<P>The next two sections give specific instructions in order to build Rezilla
in the <B>CodeWarrior</B> or in the <B>XCode</B> environments respectively.
If you encounter any problem while compiling Rezilla, don't hesitate to 
ask on the <A HREF="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/rezilla-users"> Rezilla Users mailing list.</A><P><H3><A NAME="M2"></A>Compiling with CodeWarrior</H3><P>There is nothing special about building Rezilla using the CodeWarrior's 
project file (<I>Rezilla.mcp</I>), provided you have a standard installation of 
CodeWarrior Pro 9. The only point is to verify that the search paths are 
correctly set on your machine. <P>These search paths are specified in 
CodeWarrior via Source Trees. There is, in fact, only one Source Tree you
have to declare: launch CodeWarrior, go to the Preferences and select
Source Trees. In the corresponding panel, create a Source Tree 
named <I>Waste</I> and let it point to the folder where your Waste library
is located (<I>/CodeWarrior Folder/CodeWarrior/MacOS Support/(Third Party
Support)/WASTE Distribution</I>). The other paths used by Rezilla's 
project are relative to the
predefined <I>{Compiler}, {Project}</I> and <I>{OS X Volume}</I> source
trees which are automatically set by CodeWarrior, so you should not have 
to worry about them.<P>If this is not done already, open now the <I>Rezilla.mcp</I> project. This
project contains three targets:
<UL>
	<LI> the <I>Regex_Lib</I> target should be built first. It creates a static 
library which allows Rezilla to use regular expressions internally.
	<LI> the <I>Rezilla_Debug</I> and <I>Rezilla_Final</I> targets build a
debugging or an optimized version of Rezilla respectively. Unless you plan
to do some development and debugging with Rezilla, you'll be interested only
in the <I>Rezilla_Final</I> target.
</UL><P>In order to build any of the targets, select the <I>Make</I> command in
the <I>Project</I> menu. The built products will be written in a subfolder
called <I>Output</I> and located at the same level as the <I>Rezilla.mcp</I>
project file:
<UL>
	<LI> the <I>Regex_Lib</I> target produces a static library called 
RegexMachO.lib which is automatically linked to the project by the other 
two targets.
	<LI> the <I>Rezilla_Debug</I> and <I>Rezilla_Final</I> targets produce 
the application itself (Rezilla_D.app and Rezilla.app respectively). 
</UL><P>Note that, most of the time, the Finder does not display the <I>.app</I>
extension and you'll probably see Rezilla_D and Rezilla respectively as the
name of the application: it is a bundled application, that is to say it
looks like a single file but it is in fact a folder containing all the
necessary resources.<P>The CodeWarrior project has user defined actions which take care of copying
all the necessary elements to their final destination inside the bundle:
this includes the auxiliary files (those which are not generated
automatically by the compiler). If the <I>Output</I> folder does not exist
already, CodeWarrior will create one while compiling the targets and will
also create the bundled structure inside. Provided you do not change the 
arhitecture of the source files as found in the source distribution or 
as retrieved directly from the CVS directory at SourceForge, the 
CodeWarrior project will know where to find the required items.<P>It is easy to open the bundle and look what is inside: click on the icon of the 
application while maintaining the <I>Control</I> key pressed and select 
<I>Open the Package</I> in the contextual menu which appears after the
click. Internally here is how the package should be organised:

                        4.html
                        ... etc.
</PRE><P>It is crucial, in particular, that the file <I>RezillaTemplates.rsrc</I> 
be present in the <I>Rezilla.app/Contents/Resources</I> subfolder. If it
is not there, you'll have to copy it manually from the <I>Rezilla_Rsrc</I>
folder in Rezilla's source distribution otherwise Rezilla won't function
properly.<P><H3><A NAME="M3"></A>Compiling with XCode</H3><P><B>XCode</B> is Apple's development environment. It is part of the 
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com"> Developer Tools</A>. In Rezilla's
source code distribution (version 1.0.7 or greater), you will find two
project files corresponding to two different versions of XCode: this is
because the format of the project files and the environment have been
substantially modified between version 1.5 and 2.0 of XCode. Furthermore
internally they do not run the same compiler: the 1.5 version (project file 
<I>Rezilla.xcode</I>) uses version 3.3 of the GNU <I>gcc</I> compiler
while the other (project file <I>Rezilla.xcodeproj</I>) uses the 4.0 version of
this compiler.<P>Compiling Rezilla with <B>XCode</B> is fairly simple once you have successfully taken the 
following two steps:
<UL>
	<LI> you must set the search paths to point to the right locations
	<LI> you must make a few minor syntactic changes inside the <I>PowerPlant</I> code source in 
order to avoid error messages from the <I>gcc</I> compiler.
</UL><P><H4><A NAME="M4"></A>Setting the search paths</H4>
You must set the search path for each target. This is not done exactly in 
the same way in XCode 1.5 or in XCode 2.0. The former has a concept of build styles
defined at the project's level which has been replaced in the latter by a 
concept of configurations defined at the target's level.<P>The easiest way to do so is to create <I>Source Trees</I> (just like we
did in the previous section with CodeWarrior): call <I>Preferences</I> in the
<I>XCode</I> menu and select the <I>Source Trees</I> panel. In this panel you should
define two Source Trees:
<UL>
	<LI> one called <I>CodeWarrior</I> to point to the location of the CodeWarrior 
folder on your machine. For instance, on my machine it is  
<PRE>
    /Users/bernardo/CodeWarrior_9.0/CodeWarrior
</PRE>
	<LI> the other one called <I>Waste</I> to point to the location of the 
Waste distribution 
folder on your machine. On my machine it is found in
<PRE>
    /Users/bernardo/CodeWarrior_9.0/CodeWarrior/MacOS Support/(Third Party Support)/WASTE_2.1b1
</PRE>
</UL><P>You can now set the search paths for each target: select a target and call the <I>Inspector</I>
window for this target (with the <I>Info</I> button in the tool bar or
with the <I>Info</I> command in the <I>File</I> menu). There you must
select the Build panel and find the Search Paths item in the Settings
popup. There are four kinds of search paths:
<UL>
	<LI> Header search paths
	<LI> Library search paths
	<LI> Framework search paths
	<LI> Rez search paths
</UL><P>Thanks to the source trees defined above, they can simply be defined like 
this:
<PRE>
    HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS =   "/Developer/Headers/FlatCarbon 
                            \"${CodeWarrior}/MacOS Support/PowerPlant/\" 
                            ${Waste} 
                            ${CodeWarrior}/MSL/MSL_C++/MSL_Common/Include/"
    LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS =  "\"${Waste}\" 
                            /Volumes/ib2/Devel_BD/Rezilla/RezillaSource/build"
    FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS = /System/Library/Frameworks/Carbon.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks
    REZ_SEARCH_PATHS =      "/Developer/Headers/FlatCarbon ${SRCROOT}/Rezilla_Src"
</PRE><P>In XCode 2.0 or above, you have two configurations: <I>Debug</I> and <I>Release</I>. You 
must define the search trees separately for both configurations. <P><H4><A NAME="M5"></A>Compiling PowerPlant with XCode</H4><P>The CodeWarrior compiler and the XCode compiler (<I>gcc</I>) present some differences
concerning the way they parse the C/C++ syntax. This implies that a few
instructions which used to compile with CodeWarrior could raise an error with
gcc. In order to get PowerPlant to compile with XCode, a few minor changes 
are thus necessary: this is just a matter of modifying a few instructions in the
PowerPlant source code. These modifications are described on Apple's 
developers web site in the document
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MovingProjectsToXcode/mig_after_importing/chapter_5_section_7.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001712-TPXREF166"> Make Changes to PowerPlant.</A><P>This document (<I>Make Changes to PowerPlant</I>) explains precisely which 
modifications are necessary. They concern only the following files: 
<UL>
	<LI> LGATabsControlImp.cp
	<LI> LStream.h
	<LI> LException.h and LException.cp
</UL><P>There are also modifications for the LDebugStream.cp and the
LCommanderTree.cp files but you can simply ignore them since these files
are not incorporated in Rezilla's project.<P>The same document explains how to make a header file to build a 
precompiled header with XCode. You do not have to worry about this, such a 
file has been created for you in Rezilla's sources and is automatically 
compiled by XCode (file <I>PP_Xcode.h</I> inside the <I>/Rezilla_Src/Prefix</I> 
subfolder).<P>Note that all the Rezilla source files have been written with a strict syntax which 
is accepted both by CodeWarrior and XCode.<P><H4><A NAME="M6"></A>Building the project</H4><P>When the problems above have been solved, just open the project file,
select the target you want and call the <I>Build</I> command (with the 
<I>Build</I> button in the tool bar of the main project window or from the
<I>Build</I> menu). Like with the CodeWarrior project, you should build
the <I>Regex_Lib</I> target first. There is a dependency among the targets 
which ensures that this is the case.<P>There is nothing special to do to install the necessary files inside the 
application's bundle: the XCode project takes care not only of compiling 
and building the executable but also of copying the various elements to 
their final location inside the bundle.<P>After the build process completed succesfully, the product will be found 
in the <I>build</I> folder found at the same level as the XCode project:
<UL>
	<LI> with XCode 1.5, the application is at the first level of the build 
folder  
	<LI> with XCode 2.0 or greater, the application is in the <I>build/Debug</I> or in the <I>build/Release</I> subfolder depending on the
configuration chosen to compile the target. You are normally interested in
the <I>Release</I> product unless you are developing and debugging new
code for Rezilla.
