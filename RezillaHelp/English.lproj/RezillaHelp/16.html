<H3>Lists of elements in templates</H3>
Some resources contain lists of data, for instance a list of strings, a
list of graphical objects etc. Templates are able to handle various kinds
of lists: as a header of each list, the Templates editor displays a count
of the items currently in the list and two buttons with a Minus and a Plus
sign respectively. Typically you'll use the Minus button to remove an item
from the list and the Plus button to add a new item.<P>A list item can contain different fields: they are all displayed in a
common frame which it is very easy to identify. Clicking on one such item
selects it, which the editor displays by drawing a red border around it.<P>When clicking on the Minus button:
<UL>
	<LI> if an item of this list is selected, this item will be removed from the list.
	<LI> if no item is selected, the <I>last</I> item of the list will be removed.
	<LI> if the list is empty, nothing happens.
</UL><P>When clicking on the Plus button:
<UL>
	<LI> if an item of this list is selected, a new item is inserted <I>before</I>
the selected item.
	<LI> if no item is selected, a new item is added at the <I>end</I> of the list.
