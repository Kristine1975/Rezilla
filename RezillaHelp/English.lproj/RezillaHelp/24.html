<H3><A NAME="M23"></A>The Aete editor</H3>
This is an editor dedicated to AppleScript terminology resources (resources
with type 'aete' or 'aeut'). These resources contain the dictionary of
terms supported by an application for AppleScript scripting.<P>An 'aete' (or 'aeut') resource can contain several suites such as the 
<I>Required Suite</I> (with the <I>Open</I>, <I>Quit</I> etc. events), 
the <I>Core Suite</I> (with the <I>Count</I>, <I>Make</I> etc. events)
and more application-specific suites. Each suite can contain information
about four categories of objects: events, classes, comparison operators and
enumerations. This is reflected by the Aete editor which has a unique
window and lets you select a suite from a popup menu. A bar with four
thumbnails called <B>Events</B>, <B>Classes</B>, <B>Comparison 
Operators</B> and <B>Enumerations</B> allows to select a category and
displays a subpane with all the necessary information. If several objects
are defined for a particular suite, the editor displays a slider to select
one. If there is only one such object, no slider is dispalyed. If there are
no such objects the corresponding subpane is not displayed.<P>A typical Aete editing window looks like this:
<P><IMG SRC="../../Images/rzil_aeteeditor.gif" ALT="Aete editor window" ALIGN=bottom></P><P>When an Aete editor window is active a new menu named <B>Terminology</B>
is inserted in the menu bar. It contains commands to add or remove a suite
or to add or remove objects from the current suite. Depending on the
category of the currently edited object some of the menu items can be
disabled.<P>The <B>Export Terminology</B> command, in the <I>File</I> menu, lets you
export the data of a terminology resource to a text file in format <B>XML,
DeRez, Sdef, HTML</B> or <B>text</B>:
<UL>
	<LI> the <I>HTML</I> and <I>text</I> formats can be useful simply to make an AppleScript
terminology resource human readable. It is sometimes necessary in an
AppleScript script to know the raw codes for certain terms.<P>	<LI> the <I>XML</I> format describes the entire data of the ressource
according to a specific Xml format: a DTD defining the structure of the XML
file is available in the project. Rezilla can also import this kind of
files (see below) thus allowing for the data to be exchanged. <P><B>Caveat:</B> note that Rezilla does not do any conversion of special
chars (like <I>less than</I> or <I>greater than</I> symbols, 
<I>apostrophs</I>, <I>ampersands</I>) to Xml entities. You'll have to edit
the XML files if some strings contain such characters.<P>	<LI> the <I>DeRez</I> format produces a file with a <I>.r</I> extension
identical to what one obtains using the DeRez tool: this file is ready to
be recompiled in any project (with the Rez tool for instance).<P>	<LI> the <I>Sdef</I> format (<I>Scripting Definition File</I>) describes
the data of a terminology resource according to the new format defined by
Apple. See its definition in the file <I>/System/Library/DTDs/sdef.dtd</I>
and the manual page (type "man sdef" in a Terminal window). Note that the Sdef format
does not retain all the information contained in an Aete resource: the
translation from Aete to Sdef is necessarily lossy. Rezilla does its best
to make this conversion accurate.
</UL><P><B>Important:</B> The XML, Sdef and HTML export files are UTF-8 encoded.
The text and DeRez export files are MacRoman encoded.<P>The <B>Import Terminology</B> command, in the <I>File</I> menu, lets you
import data from an <B>XML</B> file into a terminology resource. To import
an XML file, you can, for instance, create a new 'aete' resource, edit it
and select the <I>Import Terminology</I> command in the <I>Terminology</I> menu. You can also import an XML file into an already existing resource
: the data imported will be appended to the resource. The XML file must be
in the format defined in the DTD included in the project (aete.dtd, not to
be confused with sdef.dtd).<P><A NAME="MENUeditor"></A>
