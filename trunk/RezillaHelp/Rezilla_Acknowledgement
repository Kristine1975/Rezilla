Rezilla acknowledgement
-----------------------

***  Rezilla's text editing capacity is based on the WASTE library:

WasteLib 2.0 is ©1998-2002 by Marco Piovanelli
	"You are free to develop, use and distribute to end users binaries
	built using the WASTE 2.0 static libraries, at no cost.  Moreover, you
	are free to use and distribute to end users the WASTELib shared
	library, as included in the standard distribution, at no cost.  All
	WASTE-using applications must include the following credit line in
	their about box and/or documentation:
		WASTE Text Engine © 1993-2004 Marco Piovanelli
	Use of source code in freeware applications is free."


***  Rezilla's icons editing capacity took PowerPlant's ancient bitmap
editor sample code as starting point. This preCarbon code has been widely
modified in order to make it both Carbon savvy and OSX savvy, to fit it in
Rezilla's resource editing scheme, and to add a 'SICN' and a 'PAT#' types
editor.
