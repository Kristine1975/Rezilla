<H3>The list editor</H3><P>The string lists editor lets you edit resources of type <I>STR#</I>, 
<I>MBAR</I>, <I>Mcmd</I>, <I>RidL</I> which represent a counted list of
textual or numerical values:
<OL>
	<LI> <I>STR#</I> resources contain strings of characters. Each string can
have as much as 255 characters.
	<LI> <I>MBAR</I> resources contain decimal values stored on two bytes 
	<LI> <I>Mcmd</I> and <I>RidL</I> resources contain decimal values 
stored on four bytes
</OL><P>The items of the list are numbered by the editor.<P>One can select a list item just by clicking in the part containing the
numerotation, at the left of the edit field. The selected element is
enclosed in a red frame. To unselect it, just click a second time in the
same area. Several elements can be thus selected.<P>One can cycle through the edit fields using the <B>Tab</B> key. If the
<B>Shift</B> key is pressed simultaneously, rotation goes backwards.<P>A string lists editor window has two buttons to add or remove an element 
in the list:
<OL>
	<LI> the <I>Plus</I> button inserts a new element just before the first 
selected element of the list or at the end of the list if no element is 
currently selected.<P><B>Tip:</B> if you press the <I>Option</I> key while clicking on the <I>Plus</I>
button, a dialog is displayed asking you how many items you want to add.<P>	<LI> the <I>Minus</I> button deletes all the selected elements. If no 
element is selected then the last element of the list will be deleted.
</OL><P>The string lists editor supports <I>drag-and-drop</I>. Click on the left
part of an item and move the mouse inside the list without releasing its
button in order to move this item: the element is dropped at the location
where the mouse button is released. If the <B>Option</B> key is pressed
simultaneously, the element is duplicated instead of being just moved.<P>One can also drag and drop an element onto a window belonging to another
application: the string is inserted in the target window provided the other
application supports drag-and-drop of text elements. For instance, dragging
and dropping an element on the Finder results in a text clipping being
created there. 
On the contrary, if one drops, on a string lists editor window, a piece of
text coming from another application, a new element is created in the list
with this text (truncated to a maximum of 255 characters).<P>Note that <I>STR#</I>, <I>MBAR</I>, <I>Mcmd</I>, <I>RidL</I> resources
can also be edited using the templates editor.<P><A NAME="PICTeditor"></A>
