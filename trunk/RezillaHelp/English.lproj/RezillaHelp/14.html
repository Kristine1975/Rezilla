<H2>Preferences </H2>
Rezilla allows you to set various preferences. The preferences can be
accessed via the <I>Preferences</I> command in the application's menu or with
the <I>Command-,</I> keyboard shortcut (hit the colon key while holding the
command key down). This brings up a multipage dialog containing several
panels:
<UL>
	<LI> the General panel
	<LI> the Export panel
	<LI> the Compare panel
	<LI> the Interface panel
</UL>
<P><IMG SRC="../../Images/rzil_preferences.gif" ALT="Preferences window" ALIGN=bottom></P><P><P> In the <I>General</I> panel, one can set the maximum number of items contained in 
the <I>Recent Items</I> menu (by default, this is 10). A <I>Reset</I> button lets you
clear the list of recent items. One can also set the default fork in which 
a new resource map should be created (this corresponds to the radio buttons
displayed in the <I>New Map</I> dialog: the default choice can be changed in this 
dialog).
<P> In the <I>Export</I> panel, one can choose the DTD used to create XML
exports (see explanations in the <I>Exporting</I> section of the help).
One can also choose the encoding used to store the binary data: Base64
encoding or hexadecimal encoding. The <I>Include binary data in output</I>
checkbox lets specify whether the data for each resource should be included
in the export file: this currently applies only to Text and XML exports, not HTML. 
<P> In the <I>Compare</I> panel, one can set default values for the
comparison criteria appearing in the <I>Compare Maps</I> dialog: these values can
be modified later when the dialog is displayed. One can also set a default
for the radio buttons appearing at the bottom of a <I>Compare Results</I> window
and indicating the format in which resource data should be displayed
(hexadecimal or text): these values can be modified too when the
window is displayed.
<P> In the <I>Interface</I> panel, one can set the font and size used to 
display the hexadecimal and textual representations of the data resources
in windows such as the hexadecimal editor windows or the comparison results
windows. Note that only monospaced fonts (like <I>Monaco</I>, <I>Courier</I> etc.) will
guarantee a nice display with a correct vertical alignment.
<P> The preferences are written on disk in the user's preferences file only
when the application quits. They are stored in a file named 
<I>net.sourceforge.rezilla.plist</I> located in the user's Preferences folder.<P><HR>
