<H3>Compiling with CodeWarrior</H3><P>There is nothing special about building Rezilla using the CodeWarrior's 
project file (<I>Rezilla.mcp</I>), provided you have a standard installation of 
CodeWarrior Pro 9. The only point is to verify that the search paths are 
correctly set on your machine. <P>These search paths are specified in 
CodeWarrior via Source Trees. There is, in fact, only one Source Tree you
have to declare: launch CodeWarrior, go to the Preferences and select
Source Trees. In the corresponding panel, create a Source Tree 
named <I>Waste</I> and let it point to the folder where your Waste library
is located (<I>/CodeWarrior Folder/CodeWarrior/MacOS Support/(Third Party
Support)/WASTE Distribution</I>). The other paths used by Rezilla's 
project are relative to the
predefined <I>{Compiler}, {Project}</I> and <I>{OS X Volume}</I> source
trees which are automatically set by CodeWarrior, so you should not have 
to worry about them.<P>If this is not done already, open now the <I>Rezilla.mcp</I> project. This
project contains three targets:
<UL>
	<LI> the <I>Regex_Lib</I> target should be built first. It creates a static 
library which allows Rezilla to use regular expressions internally.
	<LI> the <I>Rezilla_Debug</I> and <I>Rezilla_Final</I> targets build a
debugging or an optimized version of Rezilla respectively. Unless you plan
to do some development and debugging with Rezilla, you'll be interested only
in the <I>Rezilla_Final</I> target.
</UL><P>In order to build any of the targets, select the <I>Make</I> command in
the <I>Project</I> menu. The built products will be written in a subfolder
called <I>Output</I> and located at the same level as the <I>Rezilla.mcp</I>
project file:
<UL>
	<LI> the <I>Regex_Lib</I> target produces a static library called 
RegexMachO.lib which is automatically linked to the project by the other 
two targets.
	<LI> the <I>Rezilla_Debug</I> and <I>Rezilla_Final</I> targets produce 
the application itself (Rezilla_D.app and Rezilla.app respectively). 
</UL><P>Note that, most of the time, the Finder does not display the <I>.app</I>
extension and you'll probably see Rezilla_D and Rezilla respectively as the
name of the application: it is a bundled application, that is to say it
looks like a single file but it is in fact a folder containing all the
necessary resources.<P>The CodeWarrior project has user defined actions which take care of copying
all the necessary elements to their final destination inside the bundle:
this includes the auxiliary files (those which are not generated
automatically by the compiler). If the <I>Output</I> folder does not exist
already, CodeWarrior will create one while compiling the targets and will
also create the bundled structure inside. Provided you do not change the 
arhitecture of the source files as found in the source distribution or 
as retrieved directly from the CVS directory at SourceForge, the 
CodeWarrior project will know where to find the required items.<P>It is easy to open the bundle and look what is inside: click on the icon of the 
application while maintaining the <I>Control</I> key pressed and select 
<I>Open the Package</I> in the contextual menu which appears after the
click. Internally here is how the package should be organised:
<PRE>
    Rezilla.app
        Contents
            Info.plist
            PkgInfo
            MacOS
                Rezilla
            Resources
                Rezilla.rsrc
                RezillaTemplates.rsrc
                RezillaDocs.icns
                Rezilla.icns
                Images
                    rzil_aeteeditor.gif
                    rezilla_logo.gif
                    ... etc.

                    Localizable.strings
                    Errors.strings
                    RezillaHelp
                        index.html
                        1.html
                        2.html
                        3.html
                        4.html
                        ... etc.
</PRE><P>It is crucial, in particular, that the file <I>RezillaTemplates.rsrc</I> 
be present in the <I>Rezilla.app/Contents/Resources</I> subfolder. If it
is not there, you'll have to copy it manually from the <I>Rezilla_Rsrc</I>
folder in Rezilla's source distribution otherwise Rezilla won't function
properly.<P>
