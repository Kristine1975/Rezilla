<H2>Copy, Cut and Paste</H2>
The Copy, Cut and Paste commands can have different meanings according to
the context. 
<UL>
	<LI> In the resource map table, you copy entire resources.  If you copy inside
the application, you can copy as many resources at a time as you wish, not
necessarily of the same type.  If you switch to another application on the
contrary, only one resource for each type will be copied to the clipboard:
each type corresponds to one flavor on the clipboard.  If you paste in a
resource map document in Rezilla some data copied from an external application, a
resource will be created for each flavour found on the clipboard: the
flavour is used as the type of the created resource. 
<P> For instance, if you copy an
image in a program like 
<A HREF="http://www.lemkesoft.de/en/graphcon.htm">GraphicConverter</A> and paste
it in Rezilla, a PICT and a Rect resources are created: the PICT resource
contains the data for the image and the Rect resource contains its
dimensions. This is because <I>GraphicConverter</I> puts these two
informations on the clipboard when it performs the copy. This all depends
on how applications store data in the clipboard. The other way round, you
can for instance select a TEXT resource in a resource map table in Rezilla
and paste it into a text editor: the contents of the resource will be
inserted in the editor.<P>	<LI> In the hexadecimal editor, you copy selections from one of the panes.
To paste data from the clipboard into the left pane, it must be valid
hexadecimal data. Any data pasted in one of the panes is also pasted
accordingly in the other pane: for instance, any data pasted in the right
pane is converted to its hexadecimal values and inserted in the left one.<P></UL><P>
