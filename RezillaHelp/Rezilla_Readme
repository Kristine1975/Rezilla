Rezilla
=======

Rezilla is a resource forks editor for the Macintosh. 
This is version 1.0.8.

This new version is a maintenance release. It does not introduce major new 
features and just fixes a few bugs:
    ¥ better handling of opening of files on read-only media
    ¥ better support of hex value string formats in popups
	¥ fixed a wrong offset in the items of flag popups used by
	BORV/WORV/LORV template tags (bugs 1415340 and 1415342)
	¥ fixed crashing bug occuring in certain circumstances with templates
	using CASE tags (bugs 1241475 and 1412133).
	¥ additional format to display the four values of a RECT tag in
	templates: top left bottom right or top left width height. This can be
	selected via the Preferences.

Previous versions already implemented the following features:
	¥ Rezilla lets you edit, create, modify, duplicate, remove resources
	contained in any fork (data fork or resource fork), copy, cut and paste
	them from a resource map to the other, drag and drop resources etc.
	¥ Rezilla comes equipped with an Hexadecimal Editor and a Template
	Editor. The template editor ships with no less than 392 predefined
	templates and lets you easily define and add more.
    ¥ Rezilla has several dedicated editors:
        ¥ a Text Editor to edit 'TEXT' and 'styl' resources
        ¥ a Bitmap Editor to edit any of the following types:
	  'cicn', 'crsr', 'CURS', 'icl4', 'icl8', 'icm#', 'icm4', 'icm8', 'ICN#',
	  'ICON', 'ics#', 'ics4', 'ics8', 'PAT#', 'PAT ', 'ppat', 'SICN'
		¥ an Unicode Editor to edit 'utxt' resources containing Unicode
		data in UTF-16 encoding form
        ¥ a List Editor to edit 'STR#', 'MBAR', 'Mcmd' and 'RidL' resources
		¥ an Aete Editor to edit AppleScript terminology resources
		(resources with type 'aete' or 'aeut'). It can generate Scripting
		Definition files (sdef) and export to Xml, DeRez, Html, and Text
		formats. It can also import an aete from an Xml file.
        ¥ a Pict Viewer to visualize, copy, cut and paste 'PICT' resources
        ¥ a Sound Player to play 'snd ' resources
        ¥ a Menu Editor (which supports 'xmnu' menu extension resources)

    ¥ complete scriptability to drive Rezilla from AppleScript scripts
	¥ Rezilla can export resource maps in text, HTML, XML or DeRez formats
    ¥ Rezilla can compare two resource maps.
    ¥ various values and properties can be set via the Preferences.

The Rezilla project is a work in progress. This release is the
second final release (previous versions were in beta testing stage) and is
also the last of the 1.0.x series: next version will be 1.1 and will
implement a plugin architecture in order to support third party editors. As
usual, it comes without any warranty (see licence terms). That said, it has
been thoroughly tested and has proven quite stable and reliable.
