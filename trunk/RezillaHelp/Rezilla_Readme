Rezilla

Rezilla is a resource forks editor for the Macintosh. 
This is version 1.0.1a.

The project is a work on progress. This alpha release is provided for
people who want to test it at the current stage of development. It comes
with no guarantee. Use it at your own risk.

That said, the present version contains all the basic features and has
proven quite stable and reliable.

Please read the doc contained in the Rezilla Help file. It is also
accessible via the "Rezilla Help" command in the Help menu when Rezilla is
running.

Rezilla is free software.
