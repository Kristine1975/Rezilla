<H3><A NAME="M26"></A>The icns editor</H3><P>The 'icns' resources are icon families: this is a format which embeds in a
single resource the various members (bitmaps, masks, variants) of the same
family of icons. This format is used on OS X not only in 'icns' resources
but also in the icon suite files (files with an <I>.icns</I> extension).
The icon families also contain huge icons (48x48 pixels) at various depths
and thumbnails (128x128 pixels) in compressed form.<P>Rezilla's icns editor lets you edit all the members of an icon family. It 
displays all the bitmaps in a window similar to the windows of the 
<A HREF="#bitmapeditor">bitmap editor</A> with tools which let you modify 
all the pixels of these icons at the appropriate color depth.<P>A typical icns editing window looks like this:
<P><IMG SRC="../../Images/rzil_icnseditor.gif" ALT="Icns editor window" ALIGN=bottom></P><P>It is possible to add or remove members from an icon family. All the
members are accessed via a popup menu located at the top of the window. If
a member is written in italics in this popup, it means that it is not
present in the family: click on the item to create it. To
remove a member, use the <I>Remove</I> button.<P>The icns editor also supports the <I>Import</I> and the <I>Export</I>
commands located in the <I>File</I> menu:
<UL>
	<LI> the <I>Import</I> command lets you import an icon family from a file 
with the <I>.icns</I> extension into a newly created resource<P>	<LI> the <I>Export</I> command lets you export the currently edited 'icns'
resource to a file with the <I>.icns</I> extension.
