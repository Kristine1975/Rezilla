<H3>Compiling with XCode</H3><P><B>XCode</B> is Apple's development environment. It is part of the 
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com"> Developer Tools</A>. In Rezilla's
source code distribution (version 1.0.7 or greater), you will find two
project files corresponding to two different versions of XCode: this is
because the format of the project files and the environment have been
substantially modified between version 1.5 and 2.0 of XCode. Furthermore
internally they do not run the same compiler: the 1.5 version (project file 
<I>Rezilla.xcode</I>) uses version 3.3 of the GNU <I>gcc</I> compiler
while the other (project file <I>Rezilla.xcodeproj</I>) uses the 4.0 version of
this compiler.<P>Compiling Rezilla with <B>XCode</B> is fairly simple once you have successfully taken the 
following two steps:
<UL>
	<LI> you must set the search paths to point to the right locations
	<LI> you must make a few minor syntactic changes inside the <I>PowerPlant</I> code source in 
order to avoid error messages from the <I>gcc</I> compiler.
</UL><P><H4>Setting the search paths</H4>
You must set the search path for each target. This is not done exactly in 
the same way in XCode 1.5 or in XCode 2.0. The former has a concept of build styles
defined at the project's level which has been replaced in the latter by a 
concept of configurations defined at the target's level.<P>The easiest way to do so is to create <I>Source Trees</I> (just like we
did in the previous section with CodeWarrior): call <I>Preferences</I> in the
<I>XCode</I> menu and select the <I>Source Trees</I> panel. In this panel you should
define two Source Trees:
<UL>
	<LI> one called <I>CodeWarrior</I> to point to the location of the CodeWarrior 
folder on your machine. For instance, on my machine it is  
<PRE>
    /Users/bernardo/CodeWarrior_9.0/CodeWarrior
</PRE>
	<LI> the other one called <I>Waste</I> to point to the location of the 
Waste distribution 
folder on your machine. On my machine it is found in
<PRE>
    /Users/bernardo/CodeWarrior_9.0/CodeWarrior/MacOS Support/(Third Party Support)/WASTE_2.1b1
</PRE>
</UL><P>You can now set the search paths for each target: select a target and call the <I>Inspector</I>
window for this target (with the <I>Info</I> button in the tool bar or
with the <I>Info</I> command in the <I>File</I> menu). There you must
select the Build panel and find the Search Paths item in the Settings
popup. There are four kinds of search paths:
<UL>
	<LI> Header search paths
	<LI> Library search paths
	<LI> Framework search paths
	<LI> Rez search paths
</UL><P>Thanks to the source trees defined above, they can simply be defined like 
this:
<PRE>
    HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS =   "/Developer/Headers/FlatCarbon 
                            \"${CodeWarrior}/MacOS Support/PowerPlant/\" 
                            ${Waste} 
                            ${CodeWarrior}/MSL/MSL_C++/MSL_Common/Include/"
    LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS =  "\"${Waste}\" 
                            /Volumes/ib2/Devel_BD/Rezilla/RezillaSource/build"
    FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS = /System/Library/Frameworks/Carbon.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks
    REZ_SEARCH_PATHS =      "/Developer/Headers/FlatCarbon ${SRCROOT}/Rezilla_Src"
</PRE><P>In XCode 2.0 or above, you have two configurations: <I>Debug</I> and <I>Release</I>. You 
must define the search trees separately for both configurations. <P><H4>Compiling PowerPlant with XCode</H4><P>The CodeWarrior compiler and the XCode compiler (<I>gcc</I>) present some differences
concerning the way they parse the C/C++ syntax. This implies that a few
instructions which used to compile with CodeWarrior could raise an error with
gcc. In order to get PowerPlant to compile with XCode, a few minor changes 
are thus necessary: this is just a matter of modifying a few instructions in the
PowerPlant source code. These modifications are described on Apple's 
developers web site in the document
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MovingProjectsToXcode/mig_after_importing/chapter_5_section_7.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001712-TPXREF166"> Make Changes to PowerPlant.</A><P>This document (<I>Make Changes to PowerPlant</I>) explains precisely which 
modifications are necessary. They concern only the following files: 
<UL>
	<LI> LGATabsControlImp.cp
	<LI> LStream.h
	<LI> LException.h and LException.cp
</UL><P>There are also modifications for the LDebugStream.cp and the
LCommanderTree.cp files but you can simply ignore them since these files
are not incorporated in Rezilla's project.<P>The same document explains how to make a header file to build a 
precompiled header with XCode. You do not have to worry about this, such a 
file has been created for you in Rezilla's sources and is automatically 
compiled by XCode (file <I>PP_Xcode.h</I> inside the <I>/Rezilla_Src/Prefix</I> 
subfolder).<P>Note that all the Rezilla source files have been written with a strict syntax which 
is accepted both by CodeWarrior and XCode.<P><H4>Building the project</H4><P>When the problems above have been solved, just open the project file,
select the target you want and call the <I>Build</I> command (with the 
<I>Build</I> button in the tool bar of the main project window or from the
<I>Build</I> menu). Like with the CodeWarrior project, you should build
the <I>Regex_Lib</I> target first. There is a dependency among the targets 
which ensures that this is the case.<P>There is nothing special to do to install the necessary files inside the 
application's bundle: the XCode project takes care not only of compiling 
and building the executable but also of copying the various elements to 
their final location inside the bundle.<P>After the build process completed succesfully, the product will be found 
in the <I>build</I> folder found at the same level as the XCode project:
<UL>
	<LI> with XCode 1.5, the application is at the first level of the build 
folder  
	<LI> with XCode 2.0 or greater, the application is in the <I>build/Debug</I> or in the <I>build/Release</I> subfolder depending on the
configuration chosen to compile the target. You are normally interested in
the <I>Release</I> product unless you are developing and debugging new
code for Rezilla.
