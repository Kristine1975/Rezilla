<H2>Compiling Rezilla from source</H2><P>The <I>Download</I> section above explains where one can find Rezilla's
source code distribution (see
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=83267">here</A> for 
instance).<P><B>Rezilla</B> is written in C++. It is built using 
<A HREF="www.metrowerks.com"> Metrowerks CodeWarrior</A> and relies on the
<B>PowerPlant</B> design framework which is part of the Mac version 
of <B>CodeWarrior</B>.<P>A CodeWarrior project file is provided together with Rezilla's source code:
it has been created with CodeWarrior Pro 9. The corresponding version of
PowerPlant is 2.2.2.<P>Rezilla's hexadecimal editing capacity is based on the <B>WASTE</B> text engine.
You will need to link against the WASTE library in order to compile
Rezilla. This library can be found in various places on the Internet (see
on its <A HREF="http://www.merzwaren.com/waste/"> home page</A> or on the
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WASTE_text_engine"> Wikipedia</A>). It
is also part of the CodeWarrior Pro distribution, so, if you have
CodeWarrior Pro, you certainly have a WASTE distribution: inside
CodeWarrior's hierarchy, it is usually found in
<I>/CodeWarrior/MacOS Support/(Third Party Support)/WASTE Distribution</I>.
Currently, Rezilla uses version 2.1b1 of the WASTE library.<P>Starting with version 1.0.7, the source distribution of Rezilla also
provides <B>XCode</B> project files for those who would prefer using
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com"> Apple's Developer Tools</A> rather 
than CodeWarrior. There are two project files: <I>Rezilla.xcode</I> for
XCode 1.5 and <I>Rezilla.xcodeproj</I> for XCode 2.0 or greater.<P>In any case, whether you use CodeWarrior or XCode, you will need the
PowerPlant framework if you want to build Rezilla from source. Since 
January 2006, <B>PowerPlant</B> has become an Open Source project; 
it is available on the SourceForge site at the following address: 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/open-powerplant">http://sourceforge.net/projects/open-powerplant</A>.<P>The next two sections give specific instructions in order to build Rezilla
in the <B>CodeWarrior</B> or in the <B>XCode</B> environments respectively.
If you encounter any problem while compiling Rezilla, don't hesitate to 
ask on the <A HREF="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/rezilla-users"> Rezilla Users mailing list.</A><P>
