<H2>Preferences </H2>
Rezilla allows you to set various preferences. The preferences can be
accessed via the <I>Preferences</I> command in the application's menu or with
the <I>Command-,</I> keyboard shortcut (hit the colon key while holding the
command key down). This brings up a multipage dialog containing several
panels:
<UL>
	<LI> the General panel
	<LI> the Export panel
	<LI> the Compare panel
	<LI> the Interface panel
	<LI> the Editors panel
	<LI> the Misc panel
</UL>
<P><IMG SRC="../../Images/rzil_preferences.gif" ALT="Preferences window" ALIGN=bottom></P>
<P> The preferences are written on disk in the user's preferences file only
when the application quits. They are stored in a file named 
<I>net.sourceforge.rezilla.plist</I> located in the user's Preferences folder.<P><H3>General panel</H3>
<P> In the <I>General</I> panel, one can set the maximum number of items contained in 
the <I>Recent Items</I> menu (by default, this is 10). A <I>Reset</I> button lets you
clear the list of recent items. One can also set the default fork in which 
a new resource map should be created (this corresponds to the radio buttons
displayed in the <I>New Map</I> dialog: the default choice can be changed in this 
dialog).<P><H3>Export panel</H3>
<P> In the <I>Export</I> panel, one can choose the DTD used to create XML
exports (see explanations in the <I>Exporting</I> section of the help).
One can also choose the encoding used to store the binary data: Base64
encoding or hexadecimal encoding. The <I>Include binary data in output</I>
checkbox lets specify whether the data for each resource should be included
in the export file: this currently applies only to Text and XML exports,
not HTML. <P>In the <I>Text editor signature</I> field, you can specify the
creator type of a text editor which will be attributed to the output file
so that you can later edit it with this editor by a double-click.<P><H3>Compare panel</H3>
<P> In the <I>Compare</I> panel, one can set default values for the
comparison criteria appearing in the <I>Compare Maps</I> dialog: these
values can be modified later when the dialog is displayed. One can also set
a default for the radio buttons appearing at the bottom of a <I>Compare
Results</I> window and indicating the format in which resource data should
be displayed (hexadecimal or text): these values can also be modified when
the window is displayed.<P><H3>Interface panel</H3>
<P> In the <I>Interface</I> panel, one can set the font and size used to 
display the hexadecimal and textual representations of the data resources
in windows such as the hexadecimal editor windows or the comparison results
windows. Note that only monospaced fonts (like <I>Monaco</I>, <I>Courier</I> etc.) will
guarantee a nice display with a correct vertical alignment.<P><H3>Editors panel</H3>
<P> In the <I>Editors</I> panel, one can select the symbol to use to
represent hexadecimal values: either <B>$</B> or <B>0x</B>. This is the
symbol which will be used by the template editor when it displays a hex
number. If you write an hexadecimal value in a field, you can use any of
these symbols indifferently: the editor will accept both.
<P> Hexadecimal letters (a to f) can be displayed in lowercase or in
uppercase form. This is set using the <I>Hexadecimal digits</I> preference.
<P> If the <I>Display filler fields in templates</I> checkbox is on the
Template editor will display all the tags corresponding to filling data
(see the subsection <I>Phantom fields</I> in the <I>Templates Syntax</I>
section below). Otherwise these values are hidden. Furthermore, if the 
<I>Enable filler fields in templates</I> checkbox is on, these fields will be
editable, otherwise they will be disabled and displayed in grey.<P><H3>Misc panel</H3>
<P> In the <I>Misc</I> panel, one can use the <I>Set type and creator
when closing</I> preference to specify a type and signature to attribute to
a resource file after it has been edited by Rezilla. The default values are
<I>rsrc</I> and <I>Rzil</I> respectively. This is a preference
one must be careful with because certain files, like application files,
already have a specific creator which should not be modified. There is an
additionnal checkbox called <I>Only files with .rsrc extension</I> which
limits this functionality to files bearing an <I>.rsrc</I> extension.
<P> The <I>Use Rezilla's signature for new maps</I> preference let's you
decide if Rezilla should give its signature to newly created resource
files. If they have this signature, they will be automatically opened by
Rezilla when double-clicked.<P>
