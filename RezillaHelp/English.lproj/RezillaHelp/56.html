<H3>Basic objects and properties</H3><P>The top container of all Rezilla's objects is the application itself. 
Rezilla also defines basic document and window classes which all the more 
specific documents (editor documents for instance) and windows (map 
windows for instance) inherit from.<P>This section describes the properties of the <I>application</I>, 
<I>document</I> and <I>window</I> classes.<P><H4>Application properties</H4><P>The application itself can provide some information. It has a version property 
which returns a string describing the version number. For instance:
<PRE>
	get the version<P></PRE><P>The inspector window is also a property of the application but it can be
considered as an object of its own. Its properties are 
explained in the <I>Inspector window</I> section below.<P><H4>Document properties</H4><P>There are a few properties inherited by all the document classes 
(map documents, editor documents). Rezilla defines the following common 
properties:
<UL>
	<LI> <I>name</I>: the title of the document<P>	<LI> <I>modified</I>: a boolean value indicating whether the document has
been modified since the last save
</UL><P>Here is a sample script retrieving these properties for two different 
kinds of documents:
<PRE>
	set theDoc to map document 1
	set a to the name of theDoc
	set b to the modified of theDoc
	edit resource {"TEXT", 128} of theDoc
	set theEditor to editor 1 of theDoc
	set c to the name of theEditor
	set d to the modified of theEditor
	
	{a, b, c, d}<P></PRE><P>These are read only properties. They cannot be modified with
the <B>set</B> command.<P><H4>Window properties</H4><P>All Rezilla windows (map windows, editor windows, inspector window, etc.)
share a set of common properties:
<UL>
	<LI> <I>name</I>: the title of the window<P>	<LI> <I>index</I>: the number of the window<P>	<LI> <I>bounds</I>: the boundary rectangle for the window<P>	<LI> <I>closeable</I>: does the window have a close box?<P>	<LI> <I>titled</I>: does the window have a title bar?<P>	<LI> <I>floating</I>: does the window float?<P>	<LI> <I>modal</I>: is the window modal?<P>	<LI> <I>resizable</I>: is the window resizable?<P>	<LI> <I>zoomable</I>: is the window zoomable?<P>	<LI> <I>zoomed</I>: is the window zoomed?<P>	<LI> <I>visible</I>: is the window visible?<P>	<LI> <I>position</I>: upper left coordinates of the window<P></UL><P>Here is a sample code illustrating these properties:
<PRE>
	set win2 to the second window
	set a to the name of win2
	set b to the bounds of win2
	set c to the position of win2
	set d to the visible of win2
	set e to the closeable of win2
	set f to the titled of win2
	set g to the resizable of win2
	set h to the zoomed of win2
	
	(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h)<P></PRE><P>The <I>name</I>, <I>bounds</I>, <I>zoomed</I>, <I>visible</I>, and 
<I>position</I> properties can be modified using the <B>set</B> command. 
The others are read only properties. <P>
