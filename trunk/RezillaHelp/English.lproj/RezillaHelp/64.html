<H3><A NAME="M88"></A>Resource pickers</H3><P>Picker documents (introduced in version 1.1) have the following properties:
<UL>
	<LI> <I>name</I>: the name of the picker. This is the name of the
associated type (as a string), not the title of the picker window.
  
	<LI> <I>index</I>: the index of the picker
  
	<LI> <I>readOnly</I>: is this picker read-only?
  
	<LI> <I>window</I>: the window of the picker
  
	<LI> <I>type</I>: the type of the resources displayed by this picker
  
	<LI> <I>owner</I> doc: the rezmap document that owns this picker
  
	<LI> <I>selection</I>: the ID of the selected resource
  
</UL><P>The pickers, as objects, are considered elements of a map document object,
just like editor objects. They can be designated by index or by type (the
type is used as a name for the picker). For instance:
<PRE>
    set thePik to picker "icl8" of map document 1
</PRE><P>The following script lets you retrieve the values of all these 
properties (supposing a picker document is currently open):
<PRE>
	set thePik to picker 1 of map document 1
	set a to the name of thePik
	set b to the index of thePik
	set c to the readOnly of thePik
	set d to the window of thePik
	set e to the type of thePik
	set f to the owner doc of thePik
	set g to the selection of thePik<P>	{a, b, c, d, e, f, g}<P></PRE><P>Only the <I>selection</I> property can be modified using the <B>set</B>
command. All the others are read only properties. The ID of the resource 
to select must be passed as a string. For instance:
<PRE>
    set the selection of picker 1 of map document 1 to "128"
</PRE>
To remove the selection in a picker window, use the <I>selection</I> with an empty string 
like this:
<PRE>
    set the selection of picker 1 of map document 1 to ""
</PRE><P>A picker can be opened using the <B>pick</B> command like this:
<PRE>
	pick type "cicn" of map 1<P></PRE>
If there is a picker defined for the type, the command returns the object 
specifier of the newly opened picker.<P>To close a picker, use the <B>close</B> command like this:
<PRE>
	close picker "cicn" of map document 1<P></PRE><P><B>Caveat:</B> the <I>pick</I> command applies to types. These are
elements of a map object, not of a map document object. On the other hand,
pickers are elements of the map document object, not of the map object. So
one must carefully make the distinction between <I>map</I> and <I>map
document</I>, as in the following code:
<PRE>
    pick type "TEXT" of map 1
    count pickers of map document 1
	close picker "TEXT" of map document 1
</PRE><P>
