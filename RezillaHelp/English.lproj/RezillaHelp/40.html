<H3>A simple example</H3>
Let's take an example. A 'FREF' resource is a standard type used by the
Finder to associate icons to certain types of files. It contains three
elements which are a Finder type, a decimal value corresponding to the ID
of an icon and a string indicating the file's name. A Finder type occupies
four bytes and is described by the TNAM tag (TNAM stands for <I>type's name</I>).
The icon ID is an integer which occupies two bytes and is described by the
DWRD tag (DWRD stands for <I>decimal word</I>). The file's name is represented by
a Pascal string (which stores in memory the length of the string on one
byte followed by the string itself): it is described by the PSTR tag (PSTR
stands for <I>Pascal string</I>). So the template for an FREF resource could be
schematically described this
<PRE>
	File type       TNAM
	Icon local ID   DWRD
	File name       PSTR
</PRE>
The first column represents the labels describing the kind of data expected, 
the second column contains the tags describing the type of the expected data.
The labels are just descriptive: they are the strings which you can see in 
the template editor in front of the various fields, checkboxes etc.
The most important information is provided by the tags which identify
exactly the type of the data and its size.<P>Given this template, when the template editor opens a FREF resource, it
will read it from left to right like this:
<UL>
	<LI> it will take the four first bytes because it expects a TNAM which always
occupies four bytes in memory;
	<LI> it will then take the next two bytes and interpret them as the value of the
icon ID;
	<LI> finally the remaining data should be a Pascal string: the first byte is the
length of the string, and the string itself follows. If the length byte is 
some value <I>n</I> there will be exactly <I>n</I> bytes after it unless the
resource is corrupted.
</UL><P>For instance, the following hypothetical data (here represented in hexadecimal notation)
<PRE>
	4150504c0080094e6176696761746f72
</PRE>
would be decomposed into
<UL>
	<LI> 4150504c, where the hexadecimal numbers 41 50 50 and 4c are the codes of
the letters A, P, P, and L. So the file type is APPL.
	<LI> 0080 which is the hexadecimal value of number 128. So the icon ID is 128.
	<LI> 094e6176696761746f72 indicates a string which is 9 chars long (first
byte 09). Indeed 4e6176696761746f72 is the hexadecimal representation of
the codes of the 9 letters of the word <I>Navigator</I>.
</UL><P>All this can also be seen in the right hand side pane of the hexadecimal
editor. Here is how the template editor will display the resource:
<P><IMG SRC="../../Images/rzil_FREF_Template.gif" ALT="Display a FREF resource" ALIGN=bottom></P><P>For each kind of tag, Rezilla's template editor knows how to display the
data it has just read from the resource. There is a wealth of tags which
allow you to describe a wide variety of data. More elaborate templates
would involve the use of lists, of key-controlled sections, of dynamically
computed values etc. All the tags available with Rezilla are described in the section
<I>Template tags</I> below.<P><A NAME="tmpledit"></A>
