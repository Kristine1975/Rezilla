<H2>Introduction</H2>
Macintosh files traditionally have two forks called respectively the data
fork and the resource fork. Originally resources were always stored in the
resource fork (sounds logical, doesn't it?). Since the advent of system
OSX, it is now possible to store resources in the data fork of a file.<P>Rezilla lets you edit, create, modify, duplicate, remove resources
contained in any fork, copy, cut and paste them from a resource map to the
other, drag and drop resources etc. Resource maps can be exported in
text, HTML, XML or DeRez formats. Rezilla can also compare two resource maps.<P>Since version 1.0.4a, it has a template editor which builds graphical
interfaces using a description of the format of the resource. Rezilla ships
with no less than 386 predefined templates and
accepts additional user defined templates.<P>Since version 1.0.5a, Rezilla has a bitmap editor, an Unicode editor and a
'PICT' viewer. It lets you play sounds too ('snd ' resources).<P>The Rezilla project is meant as an collaborative and extensible project:
<UL>
	<LI> <I>collaborative</I> means that all programmers who wish to collaborate
and propose patches and code contributions are welcome. You can use for this the
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=568884&group_id=83267&func=browse"> patches tracker</A> 
at SourceForge.
	<LI> <I>extensible</I> means that (in an unspecified future!) it will
support a plugin architecture to allow for the addition of external
editors.
