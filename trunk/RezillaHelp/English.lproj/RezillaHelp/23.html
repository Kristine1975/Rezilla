<H3>The Unicode editor</H3><P>Rezilla's Unicode editor lets you edit resources containing Unicode text
in the UTF-16 encoding form (for instance, resources of type 'utxt').<P>It has three menus: <B>Font</B>, <B>Size</B> and <B>Style</B> located in
the menu bar. A typical Unicode editing window looks like this:
<P><IMG SRC="../../Images/rzil_utxteditor.gif" ALT="Unicode editor window" ALIGN=bottom></P><P>By default, Rezilla uses the appropriate character fonts to display texts
depending on the UTF-16 code-points they contain. This behavior is
controlled by a preference named <I>Do Font Substitution</I> which can
sometimes slow down the editing tasks, especially for big documents. If one
knows which font to use, it is also possible to deactivate this preference
(in the Editors panel of the Preferences) and select the required font in 
the <I>Font</I> menu.<P>Note that the <I>Style</I> and <I>Size</I> menus are here only to
facilitate the editing tasks but that, as of the current release, the
stylistic settings are neither remembered, nor stored in a 'styl' resource.<P><A NAME="Aeteeditor"></A>
