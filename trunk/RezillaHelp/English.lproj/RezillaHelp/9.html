The Copy, Cut and Paste commands can have different meanings according to
the context. See the <I>Copy, Cut and Paste</I> section below.<P><DT><B>Clear</B><DL><DT>
Deletes the selection. This command can have different meanings  according  to  the
context. If a Resource Map Table is active  and  resources  are  selected
therein, they will be removed from the map; if an hexadecimal editor window is
active and some text is selected in a pane, this selection is deleted.</DL><P><DT><B>Select all</B><DL><DT>
Just as it says...</DL><P><DT><B>Find...</B><DL><DT>
In the hexadecimal editor, this command brings up a dialog in which you can
enter a string to search.
Two radio buttons let you specify in which pane the search is to  be  done.
When searching in  the  right  pane,  a  check  box  allows  to  specify  a
case-insensitive search.</DL><P><DT><B>Find again</B><DL><DT>
This command searches, from the current position, the string entered in the
Find dialog. It uses the same settings as currently selected  in  the  Find
dialog. If the Find dialog contains an empty search string, the command  is
disabled.</DL><P><DT><B>Compare maps...</B><DL><DT>
This item lets you compare two resource maps.  This can be useful if you
want to see what has changed between two successive versions of an
application or a file. The dialog window in which one selects the files
whose resources must be compared contains three checkboxes which let you
specify additional comparison options: it is possible to ignore differences
relative to the name, to the attributes or to the binary data of the
resources.
<P> The results are displayed in a window containing three lists: the left
hand side list contains the resources found in the first resource map and
absent from the second, the right hand side list contains the resources
found in the second resource map and absent from the first. The middle list
contains resources existing in both Resource Maps but which differ
according to some criterion. If you click on a resource in this list, the
hexadecimal data for the resource will be displayed in two parallel panes
in the bottom part of the window for comparison: on the left, the data as
found in the first map, on the right the data as found in the second map.
The data can be viewed either as hexadecimal or as text using the two radio
buttons at the bottom of the window.</DL><P></DL>
