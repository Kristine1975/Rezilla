README--TestForks
=================


The ScriptingTestsTcl tests suite for Rezilla uses several pre-built
resource files (TestRezillaDF.rsrc, TestRezillaNF.rsrc, TestRezillaRF.rsrc)
which it expects to find inside this /ScriptingTestsTcl/Forks subfolder.

The file TestRezillaDF.rsrc has resources in its data fork. 
The file TestRezillaRF.rsrc has resources in its resource fork.
The file TestRezillaNF.rsrc has no resources at all, neither in its data 
							fork, nor in its resource fork.


For proper storage in the CVS repository, these files have been compressed
in a zip archive named "TestRezillaForks.zip". Unzip this archive before
executing the tests suite if you have retreived the files from the CVS
repository. This archive contains exactly the same three files as above.
You can browse the cvs repository online at
<http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/rezilla>


The file named "BuildRezillaTestForks.tcl" is a Tcl script which will
regenerate the resource files in case they get damaged or lost. Executing
this script will create the above mentioned resource files in the
/ScriptingTestsTcl/Forks folder. To execute this script, open a Terminal 
window, change the directory using the cd command to the directory 
containing this script and invoke the tcl shell program to execute the 
script. For example:
cd /Users/bernardo/Rezilla/Tests/Forks
tclsh ./BuildRezillaTestForks
