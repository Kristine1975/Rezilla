Rezilla
=======

Rezilla is a resource forks editor for the Macintosh. 
This is version 1.0.5b.

The Rezilla project is a work in progress. This release is a beta
release, provided for people who want to give it a try at the current stage
of its development. It comes without any warranty. That said, it has been
thoroughly tested and has proven quite stable and reliable.

This new version adds the following features:
	¥ a Bitmap Editor which is able to edit any of the following types:

		'cicn', 'crsr', 'CURS', 'icl4', 'icl8', 'icm#', 'icm4', 'icm8',
		'ICN#', 'ICON', 'ics#', 'ics4', 'ics8', 'PAT#', 'PAT ', 'ppat',
		'SICN'

	¥ an Aete Editor to edit AppleScript terminology resources (resources
		with type 'aete' or 'aeut'). It can generate Scripting Definition files
		(sdef) and export to Xml, DeRez, Html, and Text formats. It can also
		import an aete from an Xml file.
    ¥ an Unicode Editor to edit resources storing Unicode UTF-16 data.
    ¥ a PICT viewer.
    ¥ a sound player to play 'snd ' resources.
    ¥ the Text Editor's interface has been reorganised.
    ¥ additional templates for the Templates Editor. There

	(data fork or resource fork), copy, cut and paste them from a resource
	map to the other, drag and drop resources, compare resource maps,
	export them to various formats (including HTML and XML). Set
