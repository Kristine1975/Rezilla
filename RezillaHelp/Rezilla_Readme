Rezilla
=======

Rezilla is a resource forks editor for the Macintosh. 
This is version 1.0.4a.

The Rezilla project is a work in progress. This release is an alpha
release, provided for people who want to give it a try at the current stage
of its development. It comes with no guarantee and you use it at your own risk.
That said, the present version has been thoroughly tested and has proven
quite stable and reliable.

This new version adds the following features:
    ¥ it now has a template editor which is able to edit with a nice user
  interface more than 365 resource types;
    ¥ additional templates can be defined in the Application Support folder;
    ¥ many new preferences have been added to customize the application;
    ¥ it is now possible to edit a resource using an another type's editor.

Previous versions already implemented the following features:
	edit, create, modify, duplicate, remove resources contained in any fork
	(data fork or resource fork), copy, cut and paste them from a resource
	map to the other, drag and drop resources, compare resource maps,
	export them to various formats (including HTML and XML). Various
	properties can be set via preferences.

The plugin architecture is not implemented yet and there is currently no
pictures and icons editor. This will be in future versions.
