<H3>Modifying in hexadecimal windows</H3><P>The hexadecimal windows associated with the hexadecimal editor have several 
properties which can be used to modify directly the contents of a resource 
displayed in the hexadecimal pane or in the text pane. The following 
properties are defined by Rezilla:
<UL>
	<LI> <I>maxPos</I>: the index of the last position (i-e the position after the last character)<P>	<LI> <I>startPos</I>: the position of the beginning of selection<P>	<LI> <I>endPos</I>: the position of the end of selection<P>	<LI> <I>hex selection</I>: the contents of the selected region in the hex pane<P>	<LI> <I>text selection</I>: the contents of the selected region in the text pane<P></UL><P>Here is a sample script to retrieve these properties:
<PRE>
edit resource {"TEXT",128} of map document 1 using hexadecimal
set theWin to hexadecimal window 1 of map document 1
set a to the startPos of theWin
set b to the endPos of theWin
set c to the maxPos of theWin
set d to the hex selection of theWin
set e to the text selection of theWin
{a, b, c, d, e}<P></PRE><P>The <I>maxPos</I> property is read-only. All the others can be set using 
the <B>set</B> command. Here is a short example:
<PRE>
set theWin to hexadecimal window 1 of map document 1
set the startPos of win to 6
set the endPos of win to 9
set the hex selection of win to "52657a696c6c61"<P></PRE><P>In this example, the bytes located between the specified positions would be
replaced by the bytes corresponding to the hexadecimal string.
Alternatively, the replacement can be achieved in the text pane with the
following instruction:
<PRE>
    set the text selection of theWin to "Rezilla"
</PRE>
In order to erase some bytes, just specify an empty string.<P>
