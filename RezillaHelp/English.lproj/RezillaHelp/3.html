<H2><A NAME="M2"></A>Resource Map Table</H2>
Upon opening a resource file, the resource map is displayed in  an  outline
table listing the various resource types contained in the file: if  you
click on the disclosure triangle at the left of the type, the table displays,
at the second level, the list of the various resources belonging to this
type, with their ID number, their size and their name (if any).<P><P><IMG SRC="../../Images/rzil_rezmaptable.gif" ALT="Resource Map Table" ALIGN=bottom></P><P><P> The bottom part of the Resource Map Table's window has indicators
showing the number of different types in this map and the total number of
resources. The letters DF or RF at the right of the number of resources
indicate if the resource map was opened from the data fork or the resource
fork of the file.<P><P> The lower left corner of the windows displays a small lock icon: if 
the lock is closed, the resource map is in read-only mode. In this mode you
can not execute any editing action: all the menu commands related to
resource map editing are disabled. You can still view the contents of a
resource using the hexadecimal editor but it will be in read-only mode too. <P>
