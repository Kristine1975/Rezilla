<H3>Comparing resource maps</H3><P>A comparison between two resource maps can be executed using the 
<B>compare</B> command. One must specify the two files to compare: the
first one is usually refered to as the old one, and the second one as the
new one. The command also accepts three optional boolean parameters to set
the comparison criteria:
<UL>
	<LI> if the <I>ignoreName</I> parameter is set to true, differences 
concerning the name of the resources will be ignored 
	<LI> if the <I>ignoreAttrs</I> parameter is set to true, differences 
concerning the attributes of the resources will be ignored 
	<LI> if the <I>ignoreData</I> parameter is set to true, differences 
concerning the contents of the resources will be ignored 
</UL>
The default is to ignore name and attributes differences.<P>This command returns a comparison object whose properties indicate which 
resources differ or are identical between the resource maps. One can query 
the following properties from the result:
<UL>
	<LI> <I>old only resources</I>: list of resources which are only in the old map<P>	<LI> <I>new only resources</I>: list of resources which are only in the new map<P>	<LI> <I>differing resources</I>: list of resources which are in both maps and are different<P>	<LI> <I>identical resources</I>: list of resources which are in both maps and are identical<P>	<LI> <I>criteria</I>: the criteria which have been used for the 
comparison, presented as a keyworded list<P>	<LI> <I>ignoreName</I>: have name differences been ignored?<P>	<LI> <I>ignoreAttrs</I>: have attributes differences been ignored?<P>	<LI> <I>ignoreData</I>: have data differences been ignored?<P></UL><P>Here is a complete example:
<PRE>
	set theComp to compare "HD:foo:bar:file1" as alias ¬
		and "HD:foo:bar:file2" as alias ¬
		with ignoreName without ignoreAttrs
	-- get information out of the result
	get the old only resources of theComp
	get the new only resources of theComp
	get the differing resources of theComp
	get the identical resources of theComp
	-- get the criteria
	get the criteria of theComp<P></PRE><P>
