<H3><A NAME="M113"></A>The plugin's interface</H3><P>The members of the plugin interface are defined in the <I>RezillaPluginInterface.h</I> header file provided by the Rezilla SDK. This
file must be included in the source code of the plugin. It defines the
interface itself and a few other structures and enumerations which organize the
communication between the main application and the plugins.<P><H4><A NAME="M114"></A>The interface structure</H4><P>The interface is defined as a structure made of function pointers. This is 
the list of all the functions that the plugin must define. These are the 
functions which Rezilla will invoke to execute various editing tasks.
<PRE>
typedef struct SPluginEditorInterface {
    IUNKNOWN_C_GUTS;
    Boolean  (*AcceptResource)(void *myInstance, ResType inType, short inID, Handle inDataH, RezPlugInfo * outInfo);
    OSErr    (*EditResource)(RezPlugRef inPlugref, RezHostInfo inInfo);
    Handle   (*ReturnResource)(RezPlugRef inPlugref, Boolean * outRelease, OSErr * outError);
    OSErr    (*RevertResource)(RezPlugRef inPlugref, Handle inDataH);
    Boolean  (*IsModified)(RezPlugRef inPlugref);
    void     (*CleanUp)(RezPlugRef inPlugref);
    void     (*Refresh)(RezPlugRef inPlugref);
    OSErr    (*ResizeBy)(RezPlugRef inPlugref, SInt16 inWidthDelta, SInt16 inHeightDelta);
    void     (*HandleMenu)(RezPlugRef inPlugref, MenuRef menu, SInt16 inMenuItem);
    void     (*HandleClick)(RezPlugRef inPlugref, const EventRecord * inMacEvent, Point inPortCoords);
    void     (*HandleKeyDown)(RezPlugRef inPlugref, const EventRecord * inKeyEvent);
    Boolean  (*HandleCommand)(RezPlugRef inPlugref, SInt16 inCommand);
}
</PRE><P>This structure gives the protopypes of the functions. The <TT>IUNKNOWN_C_GUTS</TT> 
symbol is a macro defined in the <I>CFPlugInCOM.h</I> 
header file which expands to three mandatory functions: <I>QueryInterface, 
AddRef</I>, and <I>Release</I>. They form the basis of the COM 
architecture: any plugin 
based on this model must define them. This is where the basic 
verifications take place: for instance, the application must verify that 
the UUIDs are the expected ones. Here are the prototypes of the three COM 
functions:
<PRE>
    HRESULT (*QueryInterface)(void *thisPointer, REFIID iid, LPVOID *ppv); \
    ULONG (*AddRef)(void *thisPointer); \
    ULONG (*Release)(void *thisPointer)
</PRE><P>All the remaining functions are required by Rezilla: Rezilla expects them
to be defined by the plugin. All of them (except for the <I>AcceptResource</I>
function) have a <I>RezPlugRef</I> as their first argument: this is a reference
attributed by the plugin to every editing transaction. More specifically a
<I>RezPlugRef</I> is a pointer to plugin defined client data corresponding to a
particular resource being edited: it identifies which resource is concerned
and which data are attached to it, since several resources of the same type
could be edited simultaneously by the plugin. Rezilla does not interfere 
with the data pointed to by this <I>RezPlugRef</I>: it just guarantees to pass it 
back in all the calls of the interface. The <I>RezPlugRef</I> type
is declared in the <I>RezillaPluginInterface.h</I> header file like this:
<PRE>
    typedef void *	RezPlugRef;
</PRE><P>When the plugin is first invoked, Rezilla loads it using the CFPlugin API
functions. This is where the factory function is called: this function is
declared in the <I>Info.plist</I> property list file, as explained in the
section <A HREF="#plugplist"> The plugin's property list</A> above.<P><H4><A NAME="M115"></A>Interaction with the plugin</H4>
When Rezilla needs to edit a resource via a plugin, there is an initial 
transaction between them. This transaction is executed in two steps 
involving the <I>AcceptResource</I> and the <I>EditResource</I> 
functions successively:
<OL>
	<LI> Rezilla first invokes the <I>AcceptResource</I> function to ask the
plugin whether it accepts to edit this resource: it passes the type, the ID
and a handle to the data of the resource so that the plugin can determine
its answer. If it accepts the resource, it fills a <I>RezPlugInfo</I>
structure also provided by Rezilla in the same function to make some
requests: the plugin could ask Rezilla to provide one or several menus for 
instance. The plugin can also attribute a <I>RezPlugRef</I>, a pointer to 
private data which Rezilla will pass back in all its calls to interface 
functions.<P>	<LI> after Rezilla receives acceptance and requests from the plugin, it 
invokes the <I>EditResource</I> function. Through this function the 
plugin receives a <I>RezHostInfo</I> structure filled by Rezilla and 
containing basic information such as a <I>WindowRef</I> for the editing window, 
the <I>MenuRef</I> pointers in case the plugin needs some menus, etc.
</OL><P>At this point the plugin can do its job to edit the resource. It can 
populate the window with controls and graphic elements, install CarbonEvents on these controls, 
etc. Note though that the plugin is not obliged to use CarbonEvents; the basic user actions 
are passed to it by Rezilla with an EventRecord via the following 
functions declared in the interface: 
<I>HandleMenu, HandleClick, HandleKeyDown</I> and <I>HandleCommand</I>.<P>When it is time to save the modifications made in a resource (for instance
when the user clicks on the <I>Save</I> button or attempts to close the window),
Rezilla invokes the <I>ReturnResource</I> function so that the plugin
returns the new data and then the <I>CleanUp</I> function so that it can
perform any post editing tasks, like releasing allocated memory for
instance.<P><H4><A NAME="M116"></A>Plugin requests</H4><P>This section gives more details about the requests made by the plugin in 
the <I>AcceptResource</I> function. The <I>RezPlugInfo</I> structure is defined like this:
<PRE>
typedef struct RezPlugInfo {
    RezPlugRef    plugref;
    UInt32        attributes;
    Rect          winbounds;
    UInt8         menucount;
    MenuID *      menuIDs;
    OSErr         error;
}
</PRE><P>Most important is the <I>attributes</I> member of the structure. This is
an UInt32 additive value, sum of different flags which determine various
aspects of the editing window provided by Rezilla and the basic Rezilla
commands supported by the plugin. The values of the flags are defined in
the <I>RezillaPluginFlags</I> enumeration declared in the <I>RezillaPluginInterface.h</I>
header file:
<PRE>
enum RezillaPluginFlags {
    kPluginNoAttributes             = 0L,
    
    kPluginEditorHasSaveButton      = (1L << 0),
    kPluginEditorHasCancelButton    = (1L << 1),
    kPluginEditorHasRevertButton    = (1L << 2),
    kPluginEditorHasLockIcon        = (1L << 3),
    kPluginEditorHasNameField       = (1L << 4),
    kPluginEditorStandardControls   = (kPluginEditorHasSaveButton 
                                   | kPluginEditorHasCancelButton 
                                   | kPluginEditorHasRevertButton 
                                   | kPluginEditorHasLockIcon),
    
    kPluginWinHasCollapseBox        = (1L << 5),
    kPluginWinIsResizable           = (1L << 6),
    
    kPluginSupportCut               = (1L << 10),
    kPluginSupportCopy              = (1L << 11),
    kPluginSupportPaste             = (1L << 12),
    kPluginSupportClear             = (1L << 13),
    kPluginSupportSelectAll         = (1L << 14),
    kPluginSupportFind              = (1L << 15),
    kPluginSupportFindNext          = (1L << 16),
    kPluginSupportImport            = (1L << 17),
    kPluginSupportExport            = (1L << 18),
    kPluginSupportEditCommands      = (kPluginSupportCut 
                                   | kPluginSupportCopy 
                                   | kPluginSupportPaste 
                                   | kPluginSupportClear)
}
</PRE><P>The <I>winbounds</I> member is a Rect structure indicating the position
and dimension of the editing window. Rezilla always provides an editing
window which can be equiped with some basic controls such as a <I>Save</I> button,
a <I>Cancel</I> button etc. The plugin does not have to track these controls: they
are managed by the main application. The plugin just decides, using the
appropriate flags, which controls should be present in the editing window.
For instance, add the <I>kPluginEditorHasRevertButton</I> flag to the
attributes to get a <I>Revert</I> button.<P>The <I>menucount</I> member indicates how many menus are needed by the
plugin (possibly 0). If the plugin defines some menus, it must pass an
array of the corresponding MenuIDs in the <I>menuIDs</I> member of the
structure. These MenuIDs are the IDs of resources of type 'MENU' which
must be defined in the resource file of the plugin: this resource file is
located in the <I>Resources</I> subfolder inside the plugin's bundle as
explained in the section <A HREF="#plugbundle">The plugin's bundle</A> above.<P>In case the plugin does not accept to edit the resource, it must return 
<I>false</I> in the <I>AcceptResource</I> function and there is of course
no need to make any request. If an error occured, the plugin can return an
error code in the <I>error</I> member of the <I>RezPlugInfo</I>
structure.<P><H4><A NAME="M117"></A>Supported commands</H4>
The basic Rezilla menus (<I>File, Edit, Resources</I>) have commands which are 
not always enabled: it depends on the context. For instance, the <I>Export</I> 
command makes sense only in particular circumstances or with some types of 
resources: similarly a plugin can support this command or not. Which 
commands are supported by the plugin is declared in the initial attributes 
as explained in the previous section: if the <I>Export</I> command is supported by the plugin, the 
<I>kPluginSupportExport</I> flag should be added to the attributes. If the flag 
is not set, the corresponding menu item is disabled.<P>Later, when the <I>Export</I> command in the <I>File</I> menu is invoked by the user, 
Rezilla calls the <I>HandleCommand</I> function with a command number so that the 
plugin can react appropriately. The command numbers are defined in the  
<I>RezillaPluginCmdIDs</I> enumeration declared in the <I>RezillaPluginInterface.h</I>
header file:
<PRE>
enum RezillaPluginCmdIDs {
    kPluginCommandCut        = 1,
    kPluginCommandCopy,
    kPluginCommandPaste,
    kPluginCommandClear,
    kPluginCommandSelectAll,
    kPluginCommandFind,
    kPluginCommandFindNext,
    kPluginCommandImport,
    kPluginCommandExport
}
</PRE><P><H4><A NAME="M118"></A>Host info</H4><P>The <I>RezHostInfo</I> structure is defined like this:
<PRE>
typedef struct RezHostInfo {
    CFBundleRef  bundleref;
    short        refnum;
    WindowRef    winref;
    UInt8        menucount;
    MenuRef *    menurefs;
    Rect         editrect;
    Boolean      readonly;
}
</PRE><P>This is where Rezilla passes useful informations back to the plugin. The 
<I>bundleref</I> member of the structure is a convenience: it is a 
reference of type <I>CFBundleRef</I> to 
the plugin's bundle in case the plugin needs to find something in its own 
structure (localized strings for instance).<P>The <I>refnum</I> member is the reference number of the resource map the 
currently edited resource belongs to. This gives access to various 
Resource Manager functions: the plugin might want to get other resources 
related to the one it is currently editing.<P>The <I>winref</I> member is the toolbox <I>WindowRef</I> of the editing window
provided by Rezilla.<P>The <I>menucount</I> member indicates how many menus have been created by
Rezilla. Hopefully this is the same number as requested by the plugin in
the <I>RezillaPluginFlags</I> structure. The <I>menurefs</I> member is an
array of toolbox <I>MenuRefs</I> corresponding to the different menus.<P>The <I>editrect</I> member is a Rect structure indicating the coordinates
of the contents area of the window which is available to the plugin, so
that the plugin knows where to place its controls and does not draw over
parts installed by Rezilla (the top placard or the bottom area containing
the <I>Save</I> and <I>Cancel</I> buttons). This Rect is passed in window
coordinates.<P>The <I>readonly</I> member tells whether the map the resource belongs to
is read-only. If it is read-only there is no point making modifications 
to the resource. In that case, the plugin would act simply as a viewer.<P><H4><A NAME="M119"></A>Error codes</H4><P>Rezilla defines error codes for the main errors likely to be encountered 
during an editing session. They start at value 5000:
<PRE>
enum RezillaPluginErrors {
    plugErr_Generic                = 5000,    
    plugErr_InitializationFailed,
    plugErr_UnsupportedType,
    plugErr_UnsupportedID,
    plugErr_InvalidData,
    plugErr_UnsupportedResourceFormat,
    plugErr_UnsupportedResourceVersion,
    plugErr_EditResourceFailed,
    plugErr_ReturnResourceFailed,
    plugErr_RevertResourceFailed,
    plugErr_CantResizeWindow,
    plugErr_CantHandleMenuCommand,
    plugErr_LastError
}
