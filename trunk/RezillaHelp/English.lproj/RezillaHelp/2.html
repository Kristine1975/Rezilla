<H2><A NAME="M1"></A>Introduction</H2>
Macintosh files traditionally have two forks called respectively the data
fork and the resource fork. Originally resources were always stored in the
resource fork (sounds logical, doesn't it?). Since the advent of system
OSX, it is now possible to store resources in the data fork of a file.<P>Rezilla lets you edit, create, modify, duplicate, remove resources
contained in any fork, copy, cut and paste them from a resource map to the
other, drag and drop resources etc. Resource maps can be exported in
text, HTML, XML or DeRez formats. Rezilla can also compare two resource maps.<P>Since version 1.0.4a, Rezilla has a template editor which builds graphical
interfaces using a description of the format of the resource. Rezilla ships
with no less than 400 predefined templates and
accepts additional user defined templates.<P>Since version 1.0.5a, Rezilla has a bitmap editor, an AppleScript 
terminology resource editor (aete and aeut), an Unicode editor and a
'PICT' viewer. It plays sounds too ('snd ' resources).<P>Since version 1.0.6, Rezilla has a MENU editor<P>Since version 1.0.7, Rezilla has a string lists editor (for STR#, MBAR, Mcmd, RidL resources)<P>Since version 1.1, Rezilla has an icns editor (for icon family resources) and an 
image editor (for jpeg, tiff, gif, bmp resources). This version also 
introduced resource pickers.<P>The Rezilla project is meant as a collaborative and extensible project:
<UL>
	<LI> <I>collaborative</I> means that all programmers who wish to collaborate
and propose patches and code contributions are welcome. You can use for this the
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=568884&group_id=83267&func=browse"> patches tracker</A> 
at SourceForge. Version 1.1 contains many such improvements.<P>	<LI> <I>extensible</I> means that it offers a plugin architecture
(introduced in version 1.1) to support the addition of external editors.
