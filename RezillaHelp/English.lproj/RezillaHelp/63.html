<H3><A NAME="M87"></A>External plugins</H3><P>Since version 1.1, Rezilla supports the addition of external editors
defined via plugin extensions. The <I>AppleScript</I> terminology has a new <I>plugin</I> keyword to get information about the currently available
plugins.<P>The plugin objects directly belong to the application object. They can be 
designated by name or by index. Here are a few simple AppleScript 
instructions:
<UL>
	<LI> to get the list of plugins
<PRE>
	get name of plugins<P></PRE>
	<LI> to count the plugins
<PRE>
	count plugins<P></PRE>
</UL><P>The plugin objects have the following properties:
<UL>
	<LI> <I>name</I>: the name of the plugin. This is the name of the plugin 
bundle. For instance <I>RezImagePlugin.plugin</I>.<P>	<LI> <I>index</I>: the index of the plugin<P>	<LI> <I>version</I>: the current version number of the plugin<P>	<LI> <I>typecode</I>: the type code of the plugin<P>	<LI> <I>creator</I>: the creator code of the plugin<P>	<LI> <I>loaded</I>: is this plugin already loaded by Rezilla? Plugins are 
loaded lazily, when the user attempts for the first time to edit a 
resource via a plugin.<P>	<LI> <I>supported types</I>: the list of all resource types which can be
edited by the plugin<P></UL><P>All these properties are read-only: they cannot be modified with the <B>set</B> command. Here are simple instructions to query the
properties of a plugin:
<PRE>
	set a to name of plugin 1
	set b to version of plugin 1
	set c to typecode of plugin 1
	set d to creator of plugin 1
	set e to loaded of plugin 1
	{a, b, c, d, e}<P></PRE>
To get a list of the supported types:
<PRE>
	get supported types of plugin "RezImagePlugin.plugin"	<P></PRE><P>In the case where several plugins support the same resource type, Rezilla
allows you to specify the preferred plugin to use for editing a resource of
this type. This can be set in the application in the <I>Plugin Order</I>
panel of the dialog window displayed when the <I>Plugins...</I> command is
invoked in the <I>File</I> menu. This can also be controlled by the means
of an AppleScript. There is a property of the application called <I>preferred plugins</I> for this: it returns a record (a sort of dictionary)
where the keys are resource types and the values are the name of the
preferred plugin associated with this type. For instance, the following 
script:
<PRE>
	get preferred plugins<P></PRE>
could return something like:
<PRE>
	{JPEG:"RezImagePlugin.plugin", PStr:"RezSamplePlugin.plugin", etc.}
</PRE><P>This property can be modified using the <B>set</B> command in order
to change the preferred plugin for some types (not necessarily all of
them). This makes sense only for types which are supported by several
plugins. For instance:
<PRE>
	-- Assume the 'jpg ' and 'tiff' resource types can be edited by several
	-- plugins and you want Rezilla to use the RezImagePlugin plugin for them
	set preferred plugin to {«class tiff»:"RezImagePlugin.plugin", «class jpg »:"RezImagePlugin.plugin"}<P></PRE>
For this call to succeed the plugins must exist. <P>
