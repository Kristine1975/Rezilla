README--TestForks
=================


The Tcl driven scripting tests suite for Rezilla uses three pre-built
resource files (TestRezillaDF.rsrc, TestRezillaNF.rsrc, TestRezillaRF.rsrc)
which it expects to find inside this /RezillaScripting_Tests/Forks 
subfolder.

The file TestRezillaDF.rsrc has resources in its data fork. 
The file TestRezillaRF.rsrc has resources in its resource fork.
The file TestRezillaNF.rsrc has no resources at all, neither in its data 
							fork, nor in its resource fork.


Retrieving the test resource files
----------------------------------
For proper storage in the CVS repository, these files have been compressed
in a zip archive named "TestRezillaForks.zip". Unzip this archive before
executing the tests suite if you have retreived the files from the CVS
repository. This archive contains exactly the same three files as above.
You can browse the cvs repository online at
<http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/rezilla>


Regenerating the test resource files
------------------------------------
The file named "BuildRezillaTestForks.tcl" is a Tcl script which will
regenerate the resource files in case they get damaged or lost. Executing
this script will create the above mentioned resource files in the
/RezillaScripting_Tests/Forks folder. To execute this script, open a
Terminal window, change the directory using the cd command to the directory
containing this script and invoke the tcl shell program to execute the
script. For example:
	shell> cd /Users/bernardo/Rezilla/Tests/Forks
	shell> tclsh ./BuildRezillaTestForks.tcl
Note that this Tcl script uses the Tclresource package which must 
therefore be installed on your machine (if you installed the Batteries 
Included Tcl distribution, it is there).
