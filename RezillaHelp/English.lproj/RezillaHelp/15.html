<H2>Template Editor</H2><P>Rezilla is able to parse resources using descriptive templates and to
build a graphical interface out of it, allowing to easily edit all the elements of the
resource. For instance, the following image shows how Rezilla would edit a 
Txtr resource containing font and size information for a document.
<P><IMG SRC="../../Images/rzil_tmpleditor.gif" ALT="A Template editor window" ALIGN=bottom></P><P>There are three kinds of locations where TMPL resources can be found. They 
are described in details in the following subsections: 
<UL>
	<LI> <I>internal</I> templates are predefined templates stored inside the
application. Rezilla ships with more than 360 predefined templates covering
the most currently used resource types;
	<LI> <I>external</I> templates are additional templates that one can add to one of
the <I>Application Support</I> folders;
	<LI> <I>local</I> templates are TMPL resources present in the currently edited resource map.
</UL><P>When Rezilla attempts to edit a resource using a template, it looks for 
the appropriate template in all these locations in the following order:
local, external, internal. You can thus override the definition of an
internal template by putting a new definition in the external locations.<P>Templates editor windows have three buttons:
<UL>
	<LI> the <B>Cancel</B> button lets you abort the editing and close the window
without asking if modifications should be saved.
	<LI> the <B>Validate</B> button lets you save your modifications and close the
window.
	<LI> the <B>Revert</B> button lets you discard the recent modifications
and revert to the last saved version of the resource in the resource map in
memory (not the last saved version of the resource on disk).
</UL><P>Note that pressing the <B>Enter</B> key (not the Return key) is equivalent to
clicking on the <I>Validate</I> button.<P>If the <I>Close</I> button (the leftmost red little button in the title
bar) is clicked and if any of the resource fields has been edited, Rezilla
will ask you if you want to save your modifications. If the answer is yes,
the modified resource is installed in the resource map. This does not mean
though that the new data are saved to the disk: this happens only when you
close the resource map table itself or invoke the <I>Save</I> menu item
when this resource map table is at the front.<P>
