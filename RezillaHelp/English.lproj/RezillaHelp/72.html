<H3>The plugin model</H3><P>A plugin implements an <I>interface</I> which can be viewed as a particular
incarnation of a <I>service</I>. In the official terminology, one speaks of <I>type</I>
to designate a kind of service: the type of an editor plugin, in the case of Rezilla, is the fact
of editing a particular resource (the word type here should not be confused
with the type of a resource!).
As of version 1.1, Rezilla knows of only this plugin type: the editing service. In
the future, Rezilla could also support external plugins defining new
resource pickers, for instance, and this would be another type since it 
is a different kind of service.<P>There is not necessarily one interface for a given type: there can be
several interfaces. For instance, future versions of Rezilla, might modify
the current interface: this would be done via the definition of a new,
additional, interface. In that case, a Rezilla plugin would have to provide
implementations for both the old and the new interface and the main Rezilla
application would decide which one to use depending on the circumstances and
the context. As of version 1.1 of Rezilla, there is only one interface for
the editing service. An interface can be understood as a list of functions 
corresponding to different tasks and which are expected by Rezilla to be 
defined in the plugin.<P><A NAME="plugbundle"></A>
