<H3>Editing a template</H3><P>Good news! There is a template for the TMPL resource types. It means
that one can edit a TMPL resource using the... template editor! It presents
the list of tag/label strings, allows you to add or remove some pairs, to
modify them etc. The only thing you have to know really is which tags to
choose. This is explained in the next section.<P>Now that the structure of templates has been explained, one can be more
precise concerning the format of a TMPL resource: the resource which stores
a template definition is a series of pairs of four-characters codes and
Pascal strings, in other words a sequence of data of type TNAM and PSTR
alternately.<P><A NAME="tmpltags"></A>
