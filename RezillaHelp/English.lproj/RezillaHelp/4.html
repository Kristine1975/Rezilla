<H3>Editing resources</H3><P><P> Double-clicking on a resource item in the table calls an editor for  this
resource. This is equivalent to selecting the resource item and choosing the
<I>Edit</I> command in the <I>Resource</I> menu. There are 
basically three editing modes for a particular resource type:
<UL>
	<LI> interface editing
	<LI> template-based editing
	<LI> hexadecimal editing
</UL><P>The <I>interface editing</I> implies that a custom editor is available for
this type: it usually offers a nice graphical interface which makes it easy
to edit and modify the resource without having to know anything about 
the internal structure of the resource itself. Only a few types have such
an editor. <I>Template-based editing</I> implies that a template is
available for this type: a template is an abstract description of the
format of the resource type which is used by Rezilla to build a graphical
interface. The <I>Template Editor</I> is thus also a graphical editor.
Many resource types have a well-defined structure which can be described by
a template. Rezilla knows of more than 150 templates. Furthermore you can
easily install additional templates (see the <I>Template Editor</I>
section below). Hexadecimal editing is always available: the binary data of
the resource are edited in an hexadecimal editor window: this is a sort of
low-level editing mode which lets you access and modify any byte of the
resource (see the <I>Hexadecimal Editor</I> section below).<P><P> When the <I>Edit</I> command is invoked for a particular resource, Rezilla
will first look for an interface editor for this resource. If none is
available, it will then look for a template corresponding to the resource's
type and invoke the <I>Template Editor</I>. It no template is found, the
last resort will be to call the <I>Hexadecimal Editor</I>.<P>
