<H3>Inspector window</H3><P>The inspector window is always present in Rezilla (it may be hidden but 
still it is there lurking in the background). To display information about 
a particular resource, one can use the <B>inspect</B> command like this:
<PRE>
	inspect resource {"MENU", 128} of map 1<P></PRE>
This brings the Inspector window with all the information relative to the 
specified resource. Each field of the inspector window can be accessed 
using the properties of the inspector:
<UL>
	<LI> <I>ID field</I>: the value of the 'ID' field<P>	<LI> <I>name field</I>: the value of the 'Name' field<P>	<LI> <I>system heap</I>: the value of the 'System Heap' checkbox<P>	<LI> <I>purgeable</I>: the value of the 'Purgeable' checkbox<P>	<LI> <I>locked</I>: the value of the 'Locked' checkbox<P>	<LI> <I>preload</I>: the value of the 'Preload' checkbox<P>	<LI> <I>protected</I>: the value of the 'Protected' checkbox<P>	<LI> <I>current resource</I>: the resource for which info is currently displayed<P></UL>
<PRE>
	set a to the ID field of the inspector
	set b to the name field of the inspector
	set c to the system heap of the inspector
	set d to the purgeable of the inspector
	set e to the locked of the inspector
	set f to the preload of the inspector
	set g to the protected of the inspector
	
	(a, b, c, d, e, f, g)<P></PRE><P>The ID and name fields, as well as all the checkboxes, can be modified using 
the <B>set data</B> command. For instance:
<PRE>
	set the name field of inspector to "Viva Rezilla!!!"
	set the ID field of inspector to 130
	set the system heap of inspector to false
	set the purgeable of inspector to true
	set the locked of inspector to true
	set the preload of inspector to false
	set the protected of inspector to true<P></PRE><P>The <I>current resource</I> property gives a reference to the resource 
currently inspected so that one can write instructions like:
<PRE>
	get the hex data of the current resource of the inspector
</PRE><P>The actual properties of the resource should not be confused with what is
displayed in the inspector window. If you make modifications in the
inspector, they will be validated in the resource only when the <I>Apply</I> 
button is pressed. To do this in AppleScript, use the <B>save</B> 
command, like this:
<PRE>
	save the inspector
</PRE>
On the contrary, if you've made changes in the inspector but do not 
want to keep them, use the <B>revert</B> command to go back to the last 
saved modifications, like this:
<PRE>
	revert the inspector
</PRE><P>To hide the inspector window, use the <B>close</B> command:
<PRE>
	close the inspector
</PRE>
Equivalently, one can hide the inspector with the following command:
<PRE>
	set the visible of the inspector to false
</PRE>
To make the inspector visible, either use the <B>inspect</B> command as explained 
above or execute this:
<PRE>
	set the visible of the inspector to true
</PRE><P>
