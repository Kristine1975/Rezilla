<H3>The image editor</H3><P>The image editor lets you view and manipulate image resources, that is to 
say resources of the following types:
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I> 'JPEG', 'jpeg', 'JPG ', 'jpg ', 'TIFF', 'tiff', 'GIF ', 'gif ', 
'PNG ', 'png ', 'BMP ', 'bmp '
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>You can paste, copy, or cut an image using the clipboard. Beyond this,
there is no real editing capacity: you must use a dedicated tool, such as
<B>Photoshop</B> or <I>GraphicConverter</I>, if you really need to modify
an image. Rezilla will just help you to import it as a resource and
visualize it.<P>The image editor is implemented as a plugin and has been introduced in 
version 1.1 of Rezilla.<P><A NAME="PICTeditor"></A>
