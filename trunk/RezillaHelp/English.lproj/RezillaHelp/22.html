<H3>The bitmap editor</H3><P>It allows you to edit bitmap image resources. This includes icons (small,
mini or large), icon families, patterns, cursors. To be more precise, it
supports the following resource types:<P>'cicn', 'crsr', 'CURS', 'icl4', 'icl8', 'icm#', 'icm4', 'icm8', 'ICN#',
'ICON', 'ics#', 'ics4', 'ics8', 'PAT#', 'PAT ', 'ppat', 'SICN'<P>The bitmap editor provides several tools to help creating or modifying a 
bitmap image resource. A typical bitmap editing window will look like this:
<P><IMG SRC="../../Images/rzil_patterneditor.gif" ALT="Bitmap editor window" ALIGN=bottom></P><P>The left hand side of the window contains editing tools and pattern and
color buttons. The following tools are available (from left to right and
from top to bottom): lasso, selection, text, pencil, eraser, bucket,
dropper, line, rectangle, filling rectangle, round corners rectangle, round
corners filling rectangle, oval, filling oval. Additionally, the cursors
windows have a red x-cross tool to locate the hotspot of the cursor.<P>Below the tools palette are three popup buttons giving access to the 
patterns palette, the foreground color palette and the background color 
palette.<P>In the middle of the window is the editing canvas where one can modify each
pixel of the bitmap using one of the editing tools.<P>On the right hand side of the window, the sample panel displays images of 
the bitmap at its actual size. It is updated immediately when the editing 
canvas in the middle of the window is modified.<P>Additionnally, the 'SICN' (black images suite) and 'PAT#' (patterns suite)
editing windows have a slider to select a particular bitmap in the suite
and a <B>Plus</B> and a <B>Minus</B> button. The <B>Plus</B> button lets
you add a new bitmap at the end of the suite. The <B>Minus</B> button lets
you remove the currently selected bitmap from the suite.<P>When a bitmap editing window is open, four additional menus are inserted 
in the menu bar:
<OL>
	<LI> the <B>Font</B> menu lets you select the font to use with the Text tool
	<LI> the <B>Style</B> menu lets you specify the size of the font and the style 
to use with the Text tool (plain, bold italic, underline etc.). One can 
also specify the justification of the text (flush left or right).
	<LI> the <B>Colors</B> menu has commands related to the color depth (depending on 
the depth of the screen). If a color is not available in the color 
palette, one can use the <I>Use Color Picker</I> command to create a new
one : once this menu item is selected, just click on one of the color table
popups to bring up a Color wheel dialog in order to select some new color.
The <I>Select Black and White</I> command is a shortcut to select black as
foreground color and white as background color. The <I>Swap Selected
Colors</I> command lets you toggle the colors selected in the foreground
and background color popups.
	<LI> the <B>Actions</B> menu has commands to apply basic transformations to the 
image. The <I>Resize Image</I> command lets you specify the width and height of 
the bitmap (only for resources which do not have a fixed predefined size, 
such as 'cicn' resources).
