<H3><A NAME="M120"></A>The Sample plugin</H3><P>This section comments the code of the <B>Sample</B> plugin provided by the
Rezilla SDK as an example and possibly a template for creating a Rezilla
plugin. An XCode project file is also provided. The <B>Sample</B> plugin
demonstrates the various aspects of the programming tasks necessary to
build a Rezilla plugin. The source code itself also contains useful
comments.<P>To learn more about Rezilla plugins, one can also have a look at the code
of the <B>RezImage</B> plugin which is a real-life example. It is included
in version 1.1 of Rezilla and is able to edit image resources ('jpeg',
'tiff', 'gif ', etc.)<P>The <B>Sample</B> plugin edits resources of type 'PStr' or 'STR '. These
are very simple resources which just contain a Pascal string. The plugin
will display an edit field to let the user modify the string and will
insert a menu in the menu bar with two commands (nothing really useful, it
is just for the sake of demonstration).<P><H4><A NAME="M121"></A>The Sample source files</H4><P>The <I>SamplePlugin</I> folder in the Rezilla SDK contains the following files:
<UL>
	<LI> <I>RezSamplePlugin.xcode</I> is the XCode project file to build the plugin
	<LI> <I>RezSamplePlugin.c</I> is the main source file defining the plugin 
functions
	<LI> <I>RezillaPluginInterface.h</I> is the header file provided by Rezilla in 
which the plugin interface and public data are defined. You should not 
modify it: just include it in the source code.
	<LI> <I>RezSamplePlugin.rsrc</I> is the resource file of the plugin
	<LI> <I>Info.plist</I> is the property list file of the plugin
	<LI> <I>English.lproj</I> is a localized folder containing a few strings 
displayed by the <I>Get Info</I> command of the Finder
</UL><P><H4><A NAME="M122"></A>The Sample UUID </H4><P>The plugin needs to define a single UUID corresponding to the unique 
factory function. This UUID has been created with
the <I>genuuid</I> utility provided by the Apple's Developer Tools or the
<I>mkuuid</I> utility provided with the Rezilla SDK.<P>The definition is found at the top of the <I>RezSamplePlugin.c</I> source file.
<PRE>
    #define kRezillaSampleFactoryID (CFUUIDGetConstantUUIDWithBytes(NULL,0x30,0x6B,0x89,0xA8,0x20,0x6E,0x11,0xDA,0x83,0x20,0x00,0x0A,0x95,0xB1,0xFF,0x7C))
</PRE><P><H4><A NAME="M123"></A>The Sample property list</H4><P>The string form of the UUID mentioned in the previous section is: 
<PRE>
    306B89A8-206E-11DA-8320-000A95B1FF7C 
</PRE>
It is used in the <I>Info.plist</I> file in two places: as a key in the 
<I>CFPlugInFactories</I> dictionary and as a value in the <I>CFPlugInTypes</I> 
dictionary:
<PRE>
    &lt;key&gt;CFPlugInFactories&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;dict&gt;
    	&lt;key&gt;306B89A8-206E-11DA-8320-000A95B1FF7C&lt;/key&gt;
    	&lt;string&gt;RezSampleFactory&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;/dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;CFPlugInTypes&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;dict&gt;
    	&lt;key&gt;306A0EF3-206E-11DA-8320-000A95B1FF7C&lt;/key&gt;
    	&lt;array&gt;
    		&lt;string&gt;306B89A8-206E-11DA-8320-000A95B1FF7C&lt;/string&gt;
    	&lt;/array&gt;
    &lt;/dict&gt;
</PRE>
Note that the key (not the value) of the <I>CFPlugInTypes</I> dictionary is the UUID 
identifying the type of service of the plugin (the constant <I>kRezillaPluginEditorTypeID</I> 
defined by Rezilla). The value of the <I>CFPlugInFactories</I> dictionary is the 
name of the function which will be invoked to instanciate the plugin 
interface: this function (<I>RezSampleFactory</I>) is defined in the source file 
(<I>RezSamplePlugin.c</I>).<P>The <I>Info.plist</I> file also declares the resource types supported by this plugin 
('PStr' and 'STR '):
<PRE>
    &lt;key&gt;RezillaPluginEditTypes&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;array&gt;
    	&lt;string&gt;PStr&lt;/string&gt;
    	&lt;string&gt;STR &lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;/array&gt;
</PRE>
and the role of the plugin:
<PRE>
    &lt;key&gt;RezillaPluginRole&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;Editor&lt;/string&gt;
</PRE><P>The other key/value pairs are standard and self explanatory.<P><H4><A NAME="M124"></A>The Sample project file</H4><P>The Sample plugin project file <I>RezSamplePlugin.xcode</I> has been created with
XCode 1.5 to ensure compatibility with older versions of the OS X System
(Jaguar and Panther). It will work with more recent versions of XCode: on 
the 10.4 System (Tiger),
versions 2.0 or greater of XCode will convert it to a file named
<I>RezSamplePlugin.xcodeproj</I>.<P><H4><A NAME="M125"></A>The Sample code</H4>
The C code defining the plugin is found in the <I>RezSamplePlugin.c</I> source 
file.<P><H5>The Sample structures</H5><P>The Sample plugin defines two structures to manage its editing sessions:
<UL>
	<LI> the <B>SampleRec</B> struct is designed to hold interface level data (a 
pointer to the interface struct and the factory ID) and 
maintain a reference count in order to control when allocated memory 
should be released 
<PRE>
    typedef struct _SampleRec {
        SPluginEditorInterface *  _rezillaPlugInterface;
        CFUUIDRef                 _factoryID;
        UInt32                    _refCount;
    } SampleRec;
</PRE>
	<LI> the <B>SampleEditInfo</B> struct is created for each edited 
resource and stores the relevant information 
<PRE>
    typedef struct SampleEditInfo {
        ResType      type;
        short        id;
        Handle       data;
        WindowRef    winref;
        ControlRef   controlref;
        Boolean      modified;
        Boolean      readonly;
    } SampleEditInfo;
</PRE>
</UL><P>A function table is also created: it is a static instanciation of a
<I>SPluginEditorInterface</I> struct (i-e the struct defined by Rezilla to
describe the interface) and contains the name of the interface functions
defined by the plugin.
<PRE>
    static SPluginEditorInterface sSamplePlugFuncTable = {
            NULL,
            sample_QueryInterface,
            sample_AddRef,
            sample_Release,
            sample_AcceptResource,
            sample_EditResource,
            sample_ReturnResource,
            sample_RevertResource,
            sample_IsModified,
            sample_CleanUp,
            sample_Refresh,
            sample_ResizeBy,
            sample_HandleMenu,
            sample_HandleClick,
            sample_HandleKeyDown,
            sample_HandleCommand
    };
</PRE><P>Two static variables hold the ID and the ref of the menu associated with 
the plugin:
<PRE>
    static MenuID    sampleMenuID;
    static MenuRef   sampleMenuRef;
</PRE><P><H5>The Sample factory</H5><P>The <I>RezSampleFactory()</I> function is invoked by Rezilla (via the
CFPlugin API) when the plugin is first loaded. This function is known
thanks to the <I>Info.plist</I> property list file. After verifying that
the type of the plugin is the expected one (<I>kRezillaPluginEditorTypeID</I>), it then allocates memory for a <I>SampleRec</I> structure and fills
it appropriately. Finally it declares the factory with <I>CFPlugInAddInstanceForFactory()</I>.<P><H5>The COM functions</H5>
The COM model requires the definition of three functions: <I>QueryInterface, 
AddRef</I> and <I>Release</I>. They are instanciated in the Sample plugin as 
functions 
<I>sample_QueryInterface(),
sample_AddRef()</I>, and 
<I>sample_Release()</I>.<P><UL>
	<LI> The <I>QueryInterface</I> function is the place where the correct interface is 
referenced. In the case of Rezilla (vs. 1.1), there is only one interface 
(this may change in the future if the interface is enhanced). This 
function bumps the ref count, and passes back the pointer to the plugin 
instance.
	<LI> The <I>AddRef</I> function increments the refcount whenever an interface is 
requested.
	<LI> The <I>Release</I> function decrements the refcount and deallocates the SampleRec 
struct when the refcount reaches 0.
</UL><P><H5>The initial transaction</H5><P>The initial transaction between the main application and the plugin is
accomplished by the <I>sample_AcceptResource()</I> and the
<I>sample_EditResource()</I> functions.<P>In the <I>sample_AcceptResource()</I> function, the plugin first verifies that the
type of the resource is one of the expected ones and then allocates memory
for a <I>SampleEditInfo</I> struct associated with this resource. The pointer to
this struct will be used as a <I>RezPlugRef</I> passed as an argument of all the 
other functions of the Rezilla interface. So the info stored in this 
structure can be retrieved by any of these functions.<P>The function <I>sample_AcceptResource()</I> also fills the <I>RezPlugInfo</I> struct
passed by Rezilla as last argument in order to make some requests to the
main application. In particular, it sets the attribute field like this:
<PRE>
    outInfo->attributes = kPluginEditorStandardControls | kPluginSupportEditCommands;
</PRE><P>The <I>kPluginEditorStandardControls</I> symbol is a constant defined by
Rezilla (in <I>RezillaPluginInterface.h</I>) asking for the standard controls to
be present in the editing window (<I>Save</I> button, <I>Cancel</I> button, etc.). The
<I>kPluginSupportEditCommands</I> constant is also a convenience value
designed to enable the commands of the <I>Edit</I> menu in Rezilla (<I>Cut, Copy,
Paste</I>, etc.).
The function makes also a request for one menu:
<PRE>
    outInfo->menucount = 1;
    outInfo->menuIDs   = &sampleMenuID;
</PRE>
The menu is defined as a 'MENU' resource in the resource file 
<I>RezSamplePlugin.rsrc</I>. It defines two (totally useless, but, hey, this
is a sample plugin) commands, <I>Reverse string</I> and 
<I>Rotate string</I>, which modify the string.<P><H5>The interface functions</H5><P>The remaining functions, expected by the interface, are:
<P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=1>
<TR><TD><I>sample_ReturnResource</I></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><I>sample_RevertResource</I></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><I>sample_IsModified</I></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><I>sample_CleanUp</I></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><I>sample_Refresh</I></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><I>sample_ResizeBy</I></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><I>sample_HandleMenu</I></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><I>sample_HandleClick</I></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><I>sample_HandleKeyDown</I></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><I>sample_HandleCommand</I></TD></TR>
</TABLE></P><P>They are defined in straightforward manner. <P><UL>
	<LI> The <I>sample_HandleMenu()</I> function implements the two menu commands:
the function passes the <I>MenuRef</I> of the menu and the index of the
command.<P>	<LI> The <I>sample_HandleCommand()</I> function is where the basic Rezilla
commands which have been enabled during the initial transaction are
executed. Currently the Sample plugin does not do anything: the
implementation is left as an exercice for the reader.<P>	<LI> The <I>sample_IsModified()</I> function is queried periodically by Rezilla
in order to know whether the edited resource has been modified or not and
to adjust the graphic interface accordingly.<P>	<LI> The <I>sample_CleanUp()</I> function is invoked by Rezilla when the user
closes the window. This function frees the memory allocated initially by
the plugin for the <I>SampleEditInfo</I> structure.<P>	<LI> The <I>sample_ResizeBy()</I> function is invoked when the user attempts to
resize the window. It returns an error code: currently the Sample plugin
returns <I>plugErr_CantResizeWindow</I> because the <I>kPluginWinIsResizable</I>
flag was not included in the initial attributes.
