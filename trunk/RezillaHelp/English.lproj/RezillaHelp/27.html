<H3><A NAME="M26"></A>The icns editor</H3><P>The 'icns' resources are icon families: this is a format which embeds in a
single resource the various members (bitmaps, masks, variants) of the same
family of icons. This format is used on OS X not only in 'icns' resources
but also in the icon suite files (files with an <I>.icns</I> extension).
The icon families also contain huge icons (48x48 pixels) at various depths
and thumbnails (128x128 pixels) in compressed form.<P>Rezilla's icns editor lets you edit all the members of an icon family. It 
displays all the bitmaps in a window similar to the windows of the 
<A HREF="#bitmapeditor">bitmap editor</A> with tools which let you modify 
all the pixels of these icons at the appropriate color depth.<P>A typical 'icns' editing window looks like this:
<P><IMG SRC="../../Images/rzil_icnseditor.gif" ALT="Icns editor window" ALIGN=bottom></P><P>It is possible to add or remove members from an icon family. All the
members are accessed via a popup menu located at the top of the window. If
a member is written in italics in this popup, it means that it is not
present in the family: click on the item to create it. To
remove a member, use the <I>Remove</I> button.<P>The 'icns' editor supports the <I>Explode</I> and  <I>Implode</I> 
commands located in the <I>Actions</I> menu:
<UL>
	<LI> the <I>Explode</I> command lets you split the 'icns' resource into
individual resources corresponding to all the members stored in the icon.
Each member has a type (like 'ics#', 'ics4', 'is32', 't8mk', etc.) and is
saved as a resource with the same type and same ID. If a resource of the
same type or ID already exists, Rezilla will display the usual conflicts
resolution dialog. Some members of an 'icns' resource are stored in a
compressed format. The Explode command uncompresses them, which means that
all the individual resources contain the real bitmap data.<P>	<LI> the <I>Implode</I> command lets you build an 'icns' resource from
individual bitmap resources. This functionality works only on newly created
empty resources: in order to implode resources, you must first create a new
'icns' resource in the main document and then invoke the <I>Implode</I>
command in its editing window. Rezilla will ask you to specify an ID (which
is not necessarily the same as the ID of the 'icns' resource) and will
collect all the resources found in the table with this ID and with one of
the types allowed in 'icns' resources.<P></UL><P>The 'icns' editor also supports the <I>Import</I> and the <I>Export</I>
commands located in the <I>File</I> menu:
<UL>
	<LI> the <I>Import</I> command lets you import an icon family from a file 
with the <I>.icns</I> extension into a newly created resource<P>	<LI> the <I>Export</I> command lets you export the currently edited 'icns'
resource to a file with the <I>.icns</I> extension.
