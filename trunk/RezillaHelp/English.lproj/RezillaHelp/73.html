<H3>The plugin's bundle</H3>
Technically a plugin is just a dynamic library which is loaded by the main 
application when necessary. On OS X, this library is packaged in a bundle, 
that is to say a directory-like structure containing the library itself 
and a few other resources.<P>To learn more about bundles on OS X, see:
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/Concepts/about.html">http://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/Concepts/about.html</A><P>Using this architecture makes it very easy, from the user's point of view,
to perform the maintenance tasks related to plugins, for instance adding a 
new plugin, removing a plugin, enabling or disabling a plugin. All these 
actions can be performed in the Finder in a transparent manner (see the 
<I>External Editors</I> section in Rezilla's help). The 
user does not have to know where exactly the plugin resides inside the 
application's bundle.<P>Here is, for instance, the internal structure of the <B>RezImagePlugin</B>, a 
plugin provided with version 1.1 of Rezilla:
<P><IMG SRC="../../Images/rzil_pluginanatomy.gif " ALT="Plugin anatomy" ALIGN=bottom></P><P>The plugin's bundle is named <I>RezImagePlugin.plugin</I>. It must have a <I>.plugin</I> 
extension to make sure that Rezilla will find it. Some elements of the 
<I>Contents</I> subfloder are required, some are optional. Required elements are:
<UL>
	<LI> the <I>Info.plist</I> file which is a Property List file containing information 
about the capacities of this bundle. See the 
section <A HREF="#plugplist"><I>The plugin's property list</I></A> below.
	<LI> the <I>MacOS</I> subfolder with the dynamic library itself 
(<I>RezImagePlugin</I> in the previous example).
</UL><P>The <I>Resources</I> subfolder may contain additional data. In the previous 
example, it contains:
<UL>
	<LI> a resource file named <I>RezImagePlugin.rsrc</I> which defines
resources used by the plugin. The name of the resource file is the
name of the executable (the library located in the MacOS subfolder of the
bundle) followed by a <TT>.rsrc</TT> extension.
	<LI> localized folders (<I>English.lproj, French.lproj</I>) with localizable 
data. In the given example, two files in both folders contain localized strings used by 
the plugin. Other languages can be added as necessary.
