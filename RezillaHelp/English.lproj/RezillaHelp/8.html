<H2>Interface Editors</H2><P>Interface editors (aka dedicated editors) are editing modes which provide a
graphical user interface specifically dedicated to a particular type (or
family of types). An interface editor is different from the template editor
because it does not rely on the existence of a descriptive template. It is
generally more powerful than a template: for instance, you can edit the
contents of a 'TEXT' resource using a template but this won't take account
of style info, whereas the Text editor will support this. There are types
which can not be described easily by a template anyway.<P>The interface editors are sometimes called graphic editors. This is an 
improper denomination because the templates editor does also build graphic 
interfaces.<P>Rezilla provides various interface editors introduced in successive 
versions:
<OL>
	<LI> since version 1.0.4, a text editor which lets you edit
'TEXT' and 'styl' resources and can handle styled text (i-e text using
various fonts, sizes, styles).<P>	<LI> since version 1.0.5, a bitmap resources editor, a picture viewer for
'PICT' resources, a sound player ('snd '), a Unicode editor ('utxt').
</OL><P>Future versions of Rezilla will have additional interface editors. <P><H3>The text editor</H3><P>The text editor has three menus: <B>Font</B>, <B>Size</B>, and 
<B>Style</B> located at the top of the text editing window. <P>If you edit a resource with type 'TEXT' for which a 'styl' resource 
<I>with the same ID</I> exists, Rezilla reads the style information contained in 
this resource (font, size, face) and applies it to the text. Otherwise, 
the text resource is displayed using the default style settings.<P>When a new resource with type 'TEXT' is created, the text editor uses the 
default settings too. If some modifications have been made using one of 
the three menus, Rezilla will automatically create a 'styl' resource with 
the same ID as the 'TEXT' resource itself upon saving, in order to store 
the style information.<P><H3>The bitmap editor</H3><P>It allows you to edit bitmap image resources. This includes icons (small,
mini or large), icon families, patterns, cursors. To be more precise, it
supports the following resource types:<P>'cicn', 'crsr', 'CURS', 'icl4', 'icl8', 'icm#', 'icm4', 'icm8', 'ICN#',
'ICON', 'ics#', 'ics4', 'ics8', 'PAT#', 'PAT ', 'ppat', 'SICN'<P>The bitmap editor provides several tools to help creating or modifying a 
bitmap image resource. A typical bitmap editing window will look like this:
<P><IMG SRC="../../Images/rzil_patterneditor.gif" ALT="Bitmap editor window" ALIGN=bottom></P><P>The left hand side of the window contains editing tools and pattern and
color buttons. The following tools are available (from left to right and
from top to bottom): lasso, selection, text, pencil, eraser, bucket,
dropper, line, rectangle, filling rectangle, round corners rectangle, round
corners filling rectangle, oval, filling oval. Additionally, the cursors
windows have a red x-cross tool to locate the hotspot of the cursor.<P>Below the tools palette are three popup buttons giving access to the 
patterns palette, the foreground color palette and the background color 
palette.<P>In the middle of the window is the editing canvas where one can modify each
pixel of the bitmap using one of the editing tools.<P>On the right hand side of the window, the sample panel displays images of 
the bitmap at its actual size. It is updated immediately when the editing 
canvas in the middle of the window is modified.<P>Additionnally, the 'SICN' (black images suite) and 'PAT#' (patterns suite)
editing windows have a slider to select a particular bitmap in the suite
and a <B>Plus</B> and a <B>Minus</B> button. The <B>Plus</B> button lets
you add a new bitmap at the end of the suite. The <B>Minus</B> button lets
you remove the currently selected bitmap from the suite.<P>When a bitmap editing window is open, four additional menus are inserted 
in the menu bar:
<OL>
	<LI> the <B>Font</B> menu lets you select the font to use with the Text tool
	<LI> the <B>Style</B> menu lets you specify the size of the font and the style 
to use with the Text tool (plain, bold italic, underline etc.). One can 
also specify the justification of the text (flush left or right).
	<LI> the <B>Colors</B> menu has commands related to the color depth (depending on 
the depth of the screen). If a color is not available in the color 
palette, one can use the <I>Use Color Picker</I> command to create a new
one : once this menu item is selected, just click on one of the color table
popups to bring up a Color wheel dialog in order to select some new color.
The <I>Select Black and White</I> command is a shortcut to select black as
foreground color and white as background color. The <I>Swap Selected
Colors</I> command lets you toggle the colors selected in the foreground
and background color popups.
	<LI> the <B>Actions</B> menu has commands to apply basic transformations to the 
image. The <I>Resize Image</I> command lets you specify the width and height of 
the bitmap (only for resources which do not have a fixed predefined size, 
such as 'cicn' resources).
</OL><P><H3>The Unicode editor</H3><P>Rezilla's Unicode editor lets you edit resources containing Unicode text
in the UTF-16 encoding form (for instance, resources of type 'utxt').<P>It has three menus: <B>Font</B>, <B>Size</B> and <B>Style</B> located in
the menu bar. A typical Unicode editing window looks like this:
<P><IMG SRC="../../Images/rzil_utxteditor.gif" ALT="Unicode editor window" ALIGN=bottom></P><P>By default, Rezilla uses the appropriate character fonts to display texts
depending on the UTF-16 code-points they contain. This behavior is
controlled by a preference named <I>Do Font Substitution</I> which can
sometimes slow down the editing tasks, especially for big documents. If one
knows which font to use, it is also possible to deactivate this preference
(in the Editors panel of the Preferences) and select the required font in 
the <I>Font</I> menu.<P>Note that the <I>Style</I> and <I>Size</I> menus are here only to
facilitate the editing tasks but that, as of the current release, the
stylistic settings are neither remembered, nor stored in a 'styl' resource.<P><H3>The Aete editor</H3>
This is an editor dedicated to AppleScript terminology resources (resources
with type 'aete' or 'aeut'). These resources contain the dictionary of
terms supported by an application for AppleScript scripting.<P>An 'aete' (or 'aeut') resource can contain several suites such as the 
<I>Required Suite</I> (with the <I>Open</I>, <I>Quit</I> etc. events), 
the <I>Core Suite</I> (with the <I>Count</I>, <I>Make</I> etc. events)
and more application-specific suites. Each suite can contain information
about four categories of objects: events, classes, comparison operators and
enumerations. This is reflected by the Aete editor which has a unique
window and lets you select a suite from a popup menu. A bar with four
thumbnails called <B>Events</B>, <B>Classes</B>, <B>Comparison 
Operators</B> and <B>Enumerations</B> allows to select a category and
displays a subpane with all the necessary information. If several objects
are defined for a particular suite, the editor displays a slider to select
one. If there is only one such object, no slider is dispalyed. If there are
no such objects the corresponding subpane is not displayed.<P>A typical Aete editing window looks like this:
<P><IMG SRC="../../Images/rzil_aeteeditor.gif" ALT="Aete editor window" ALIGN=bottom></P><P>When an Aete editor window is active a new menu named <B>Terminology</B>
is inserted in the menu bar. It contains commands to add or remove a suite
or to add or remove objects from the current suite. Depending on the
category of the currently edited object some of the menu items can be
disabled.<P>There is also an <B>Export Terminology</B> command which lets you export
the entire resource data to a text file in XML format. This can be useful
to make an AppleScript terminology resource readable.<P><H3>The 'PICT' editor</H3><P>Not a fully fledged editor but rather a viewer. If you double-click on a
picture resource (of type <I>'PICT'</I>), Rezilla displays the image.<P>The <I>Copy</I>, <I>Cut</I> and <I>Paste</I> commands are enabled. You
can copy the image to the clipboard (no need to select anything, the entire
image is automatically copied). On the contrary, if the clipboard contains
a picture (more technically speaking, contains data with 'PICT' flavor),
Rezilla will replace the current image by the contents of the clipboard.<P>This allows you to create images in another graphic application and import
it into Rezilla . Note that you can also paste graphic data directly from
the clipboard to a resource map document in Rezilla (see the <I>Copy, Cut
and Paste</I> section in this document).<P><H3>The 'snd ' editor</H3><P>Not really an editor but rather a player. If you double-click on a sound
resource (of type <I>'snd '</I>), Rezilla plays the sound. Make sure the
volume is not set to 0 on your system.<P>
