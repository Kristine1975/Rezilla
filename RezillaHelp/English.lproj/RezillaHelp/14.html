<H2>Hexadecimal Editor</H2>
<P><IMG SRC="../../Images/rzil_hexeditor.gif " ALT="Hexadecimal Editor" ALIGN=bottom></P><P>The <I>Hexadecimal Editor</I> lets you edit the resource  data.  It  displays  two
panes: the left pane contains the hexadecimal values of each byte  and  the
right pane contains a readable representation of the  corresponding  bytes.
Bytes whose code is above 128 are represented by a circumflex symbol, bytes
whose code is under 32 are represented by  a  reversed  circumflex  symbol.
Bytes whose code is between  33  and  127  are  represented  by  the  Ascii
character with the same code. Blank spaces (code 32) are represented  by  a
dot. <P><P> There are two editable fields at the bottom of the  hexadecimal  editor
window indicating the current selection's line range and offset range. These
fields can be used for navigation: if you type a line number  in  the  line
field and press the Return key, the editor will  display  and  hilite  this
line. Ditto with the Offset field. You can  also  type  a  range  in  these
fields. For instance if you type 45-97 in the Offset field, the hexadecimal
editor will display the region containing the bytes 45 to 97 (inclusive) and
hilite them.<P><P> When the resource map is in read-only mode, the lower left corner of
the hexadecimal editor's window will display a closed lock icon. The two
panes will also be in read-only mode: no modification is possible in that
case.<P>
