<H2>Drag and Drop</H2>
Rezilla provides various aspects of Drag and Drop capacity. You can
drag a selection of resources from a resource map table to another to have
them copied to the destination resource map. If the destination resource
map is the same as the original one, the resources are simply duplicated.<P><P> If you drag a selection of resources from a resource map table to the trash
in the Finder, these resources are deleted from the resource map.<P><P> If you drag a piece of text from an external text editor to a  resource
map table, a new resource of type TEXT containing this text is created.
More generally speaking, if you drag a  selection  of  some  "flavor"  to  a
resource map table in Rezilla, resources of the same type as the flavor are
created. For instance, if you drag an image selected in a program such as
<A HREF="http://www.lemkesoft.de/en/graphcon.htm">GraphicConverter</A> 
to Rezilla, two resources are created: one resource of type Rect will  contain
the dimensions of the image, another resource of type PICT will  contain  a
pict representation of the image.<P><P> In the Resource Maps Comparison dialog, one can drag and drop a file
from the Finder onto one of the file fields to select it rather than using
the <I>Set</I> button.<P>
