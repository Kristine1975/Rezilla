<H3>Local templates</H3><P>Some resource files already contain TMPL resources for some types. In case 
you want to edit, in such a file, a resource having one of these types, Rezilla
will automatically use the provided TMPL resource. Such a template is
called a <I>local template</I> because it is found in the resource map you are
currently editing and won't be available anymore as soon as this table is
closed.<P>This can be useful if you transmit a non standeard resource to somebody and
want to be sure he will be able to view it with the template editor. You
just have to copy the TMPL resource in the resource file you transmit.<P>The template editor always looks for a TMPL resource in the current map
before it tries to find an external or an internal template.<P>
