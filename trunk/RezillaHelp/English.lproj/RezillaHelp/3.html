<H2>Resource Map Table</H2>
Upon opening a resource file, the resource map is displayed in  an  outline
table which lists the various resource types contained in the file: if  you
click on the disclosure triangle at the left of the type, the table displays,
at the second level, the list of the various resources belonging to this  type,  with
their ID number, their size and their name (if any).<P><P><IMG SRC="../../Images/rzil_rezmaptable.gif" ALT="Resource Map Table" ALIGN=bottom></P><P>Double-clicking on a resource item calls the <I>Hexadecimal  Editor</I>  for  this
resource. This is equivalent to selecting the resource item and choosing  the
<I>Edit</I> command in the <I>Resource</I> menu.<P><P> Option-clicking on a resource item calls the <I>Inspector window</I> for  this
resource. This is equivalent to selecting the resource item and choosing  the
<I>Get Info</I> command in the <I>Resource</I> menu. See the <I>Inspector window</I> section
below.<P><P> Note that clicking on a disclosure triangle with  the  option-key  down
will act upon all the resource types: if the triangle  was  in  the  closed
state, all resource types will be opened, if it was in  the  opened  state,
then all the resource types will be closed.<P><P> The bottom part of the Resource Map Table's window has indicators
showing the number
of different types in this map and the total number of resources.
The letters DF or RF at the right of the number of resources indicate if the
resource map was opened from the data fork or the resource fork of the file.<P><P> The lower left corner of the windows displays a small lock icon: if 
the lock is closed, the resource map is in read-only mode. In this mode you
can not execute any editing action: all the menu commands related to
resource map editing are disabled. You can still view the contents of a
resource using the hexadecimal editor but it will be in read-only mode too. <P>
