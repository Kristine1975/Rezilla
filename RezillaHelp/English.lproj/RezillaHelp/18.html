One can add new templates to those already defined internally by Rezilla.
New templates must be located in one of the <I>Application Support</I>
folders. When Rezilla is launched, it creates, if they do not already exist,
subfolders called <I>Rezilla</I> in the <I>Application Support</I> folder of the
currently logged-in user and in the local system wide <I>Application
Support</I> folder inside the <I>Library</I> folder. These locations are
usually referred to as the user domain and the local domain respectively.
Inside this folder is a <I>Templates</I> subfolder which is where the additional
templates should be located for Rezilla to take them into account.
Concretely, the folder paths are like this:
<PRE>
	~/Library/Application Support/Rezilla/Templates
	Library/Application Support/Rezilla/Templates
</PRE>
A template file is a file with a resource map containing resources of
type TMPL. The resource map can be stored in the datafork or in the
resource fork of the file.<P>Rezilla reads the contents of the <I>Application Support/Rezilla/Templates</I>
folders at startup. If you add new template files there, you will have to
quit and relaunch Rezilla in order to make them available to the
application.<P>
