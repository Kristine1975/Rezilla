<H2>Interface Editors</H2><P>Interface editors are editing modes which provide a graphical user
interface specifically dedicated to a particular type (or family of types).
An interface editor is different from the template editor because it does
not rely on the existence of a descriptive template. It is generally
more powerful than a template: for instance, you can edit the contents of a
'TEXT' resource using a template but this won't take account of style info,
whereas the Text editor will support this. There are types which can not be
described easily by a template anyway.<P>As of version 1.0.4, Rezilla provides a text editor which lets you edit
'TEXT' and 'styl' resources and can handle styled text (i-e text using
various fonts, sizes, styles).<P>Future versions of Rezilla will have additional interface editors, in
particular to edit icon resources. <P>
