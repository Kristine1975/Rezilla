Rezilla

Rezilla is a resource forks editor for the Macintosh. 
This is version 1.0.1a.

The Rezilla project is a work in progress. This alpha release is provided
as a foretaste for people who want to give it a try at the current stage of
development. It comes with no guarantee. Use it at your own risk.

That said, the present version contains all the basic features and has
proven quite stable and reliable: it lets you edit, create, modify,
duplicate, remove resources contained in any fork (data fork or resource
fork), copy, cut and paste them from a resource map to the other, drag and
drop resources, compare resource maps etc. 
On the other hand, the custom editors and the plugin architecture are not
implemented yet.

Please read the doc contained in the Rezilla Help file. It is also
accessible via the "Rezilla Help" command in the Help menu
when Rezilla is running.

Rezilla is free software.
