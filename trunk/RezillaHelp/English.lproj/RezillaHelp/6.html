<H3>Modifier keys</H3>
<P> When double-clicking on a resource in the resource map table, one can also
use a modifier key:
<UL>
	<LI> if the shift key is pressed while double-clicking, the <I>Template
Editor</I> is called directly. If no template is available, then the 
<I>Hexadecimal Editor</I> is called instead.
	<LI> if the option key is pressed while double-clicking, the 
<I>Hexadecimal Editor</I> is called directly.
</UL><P><P> Several resources can be selected simultaneously in the 
table in order to edit them.<P><P> Control-clicking (single click) on a resource item in the table calls the 
<I>Inspector window</I> for this resource. This is equivalent to selecting
the resource item and choosing the <I>Get Info</I> command in the 
<I>Resource</I> menu. See the <I>Inspector window</I> section below.<P><P> Note that clicking on a disclosure triangle with  the  option-key  down
will act upon all the resource types: if the triangle  was  in  the  closed
state, all resource types will be opened, if it was in  the  opened  state,
then all the resource types will be closed.<P>
