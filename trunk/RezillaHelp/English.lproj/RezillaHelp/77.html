<H3>The plugin's UUIDs</H3><P>Various elements of the Core Foundation plugin model are identified using 
an UUID (<I>Universally Unique Identifier</I>). Some UUIDs are defined on the 
main application's side, others on the plugin's side.<P>An UUID is a 128-bits value guaranteed to be unique. It can be represented
in two forms: a byte form and a string form. The byte form is a C structure
defined in the Core Foundations (see the <I>CFUUIDBytes</I> struct in the CFUUID.h header
file). The string form is a convenience form: it is a hyphen-punctuated
ASCII string which is used, for instance, in the property list of the
plugin (see the section <A HREF="#plugplist"> The plugin's property list</A> below).<P><H4>Rezilla UUIDs</H4>
Rezilla defines two UUIDs to refer to the type of the plugin and to the
factory implementing the interface respectively. The values are defined in
the <I>RezillaPluginInterface.h</I> header file using symbolic values: 
<UL>
	<LI> <I>kRezillaPluginEditorTypeID</I> is the UUID of the editing type. This is 
the unique identifier which says that we are dealing with a Rezilla plugin
and not a plugin for, say, iMovie or iDVD.<P>	<LI> <I>kRezillaPluginEditorInterfaceVs1</I> is the UUID which
characterizes the current interface defining the editing type. Its name
ends with <I>Vs1</I> to suggest that this is a first version of the
interface and that there might be new interfaces in the future
(possibly with enhanced functionalities). Anyway, as of version 1.1 of 
Rezilla, there is only one type and one interface.
</UL>
These UUIDs are defined like this:
<PRE>
    #define kRezillaPluginEditorTypeID (CFUUIDGetConstantUUIDWithBytes(NULL,0x30,0x6A,0x0E,0xF3,0x20,0x6E,0x11,0xDA,0x83,0x20,0x00,0x0A,0x95,0xB1,0xFF,0x7C))
    #define kRezillaPluginEditorInterfaceVs1 (CFUUIDGetConstantUUIDWithBytes(NULL,0x30,0x6A,0xE1,0x67,0x20,0x6E,0x11,0xDA,0x83,0x20,0x00,0x0A,0x95,0xB1,0xFF,0x7C))
</PRE>
which can be written in string form as:
<PRE>
    306A0EF3-206E-11DA-8320-000A95B1FF7C
    306AE167-206E-11DA-8320-000A95B1FF7C
</PRE><P><H4>Factory UUIDs</H4>
The plugin will have to provide UUIDs for all the implementations of 
interfaces it contains. The implementation is done by a <I>factory</I> 
function. These factory functions are declared in the property list of the 
plugin and defined in the plugin itself. The <I>RezillaImage</I> plugin for instance supports Rezilla's editing 
type and its associated interface, so it has to define one 
factory UUID. So its C code contains the following instruction:
<PRE>
    #define kRezillaImageFactoryID (CFUUIDGetConstantUUIDWithBytes(NULL,0x09,0x05,0xF8,0x36,0xA2,0x0C,0x11,0xDA,0xBC,0x6C,0x00,0x0A,0x95,0xB1,0xFF,0x7C))
</PRE>
and its property list declares this same value in string form as
<PRE>
    0905F836-A20C-11DA-BC6C-000A95B1FF7C
</PRE>
In case there are several interfaces, each interface must have an UUID.<P><H4>Generating an UUID</H4>
There is a simple command line tool called <B>uuidgen</B>, provided with
the Apple's Developers Tools, which generates UUIDs. Here is an example of
the uuidgen usage (to execute in a Terminal window):
<PRE>
    shell> uuidgen
    9A347042-427C-11DB-9237-000A95B1FF7C
</PRE><P>The Rezilla SDK also provides a slightly more elaborate tool called 
<B>mkuuid</B>. With mkuuid you can specify the number of UUIDs you want to generate
and its output returns the UUIDs both in bytes form (to use in the C code)
and in string form (to use in the property list). Here is an example of its
usage:
<PRE>
    shell> mkuuid 2
    UUID as bytes: (NULL,0xC1,0x37,0x86,0xB4,0x42,0x7C,0x11,0xDB,0xA0,0xC4,0x00,0x0A,0x95,0xB1,0xFF,0x7C)
    UUID as string: "C13786B4-427C-11DB-A0C4-000A95B1FF7C"
    
    UUID as bytes: (NULL,0xC1,0x38,0x2C,0x85,0x42,0x7C,0x11,0xDB,0xA0,0xC4,0x00,0x0A,0x95,0xB1,0xFF,0x7C)
    UUID as string: "C1382C85-427C-11DB-A0C4-000A95B1FF7C"
