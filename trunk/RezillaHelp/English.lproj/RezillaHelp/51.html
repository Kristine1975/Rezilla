<H3>Rezilla's object model</H3><P>There are basically three types of objects in Rezilla: documents, windows
and maps. The term map is used to designate the entire contents of a
resource fork.<P>Each map can be considered as a data base whose elements are characterized
by a type and an ID. Rezilla's object model uses a similar structure: a 
<I>map</I> object contains <I>type</I> objects, and these <I>type</I>
objects themselves contain <I>resource</I> objects. A map object is always
associated with a resource map document, just like a resource <I>belongs</I> 
to a map.<P>There are two kinds of documents: 
<UL>
	<LI> resource map documents correspond to the outline window displayed 
when a resource file is opened by Rezilla.
	<LI> editor documents correspond to the editing windows in which 
individual resources can be edited. An editor document necessarily <I>belongs</I> 
to a resource map document.
</UL><P>For instance, one can get a list of all the windows, maps or documents 
with a command like this (the word <B>get</B> is optional):
<PRE>
	get windows
	get maps
	get documents
</PRE><P><H4>Map document properties</H4>
Map documents can be specified by name or by index. The name is the name 
of the file this document was opened from: it is not unique since 
different files can have the same name (if they are in different folders). 
On the contrary, the index is unique at a given time: it is the index of
the document among all the other map documents opened in Rezilla. The index
is not permanent though: it can vary as other documents get closed.<P>Besides the properties shared by all the document objects (see below), map 
documents also have a set of specific properties:
<UL>
	<LI> <I>index</I>: the index of the document among other map documents<P>	<LI> <I>readOnly</I>: is this document read-only?<P>	<LI> <I>window</I>: the window associated with this document<P>	<LI> <I>refnum</I>: the reference number of the map in memory<P>	<LI> <I>fork</I>: the fork this document is editing (data fork or resource fork)<P>	<LI> <I>map</I>: the resource map associated with this document<P>	<LI> <I>file</I>: the file on disk corresponding to this resource map document<P>	<LI> <I>format</I>: the format used for export
</UL><P>For instance, the following script lets you retrieve the values of all these 
properties:
<PRE>
	set mapDoc to map document 1
	set a to the name of mapDoc
	set b to the refnum of mapDoc
	set c to the fork of mapDoc
	set d to the index of mapDoc
	set e to the readOnly of mapDoc
	set f to the window of mapDoc
	set g to the file of mapDoc
	set h to the format of mapDoc
	
	{a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h}<P></PRE><P>The <I>format</I> property can be modified using the <B>set</B> command. 
All the others are read only properties. For instance:
<PRE>
	set the format of map document 1 to html<P></PRE><P><H4>Editor document properties</H4>
Editor documents also have properties of their own, besides the properties 
shared by all the document objects Rezilla defines the following:
<UL>
	<LI> <I>index</I>: the index of the editor document among all the editor 
documents depending from the same map document<P>	<LI> <I>kind</I>: the kind of the editor document 
(<I>hexadecimal</I>, <I>template</I> or <I>interface</I>)<P>	<LI> <I>readOnly</I>: is this document read-only?<P>	<LI> <I>window</I>: the window associated with this document<P>	<LI> <I>resource</I>: the resource edited by this document<P>	<LI> <I>owner doc</I>: the rezmap document that owns this editor document
</UL><P>For instance, the following script lets you retrieve the values of all these 
properties (supposing an editor document is currently open):
<PRE>
	set theEd to editor 1 of map document 1
	set a to the index of theEd
	set b to the kind of theEd
	set c to the readOnly of theEd
	set d to the window of theEd
	set e to the resource of theEd
	set f to the owner doc of theEd
	
	{a, b, c, d, e, f}<P></PRE><P>All these properties are read only properties. They cannot be modified 
using the <B>set</B> command.<P><H4>Map window properties</H4>
The <I>map window</I> class designates the window displayed by resource map 
documents. These objects have two properties corresponding to the count 
fields located at the bottom of the window:
<UL> 
	<LI> <I>types count</I>: number of types in this map, as displayed at the bottom of the map window<P>	<LI> <I>resources count</I>: total number of resources in this map, as displayed at the bottom of the map window<P></UL><P>You obtain these values like this for instance:
<PRE>
	set mapWin to map window 1
	set a to the types count of mapWin
	set b to the resources count of mapWin
	{a, b}<P></PRE>
These are read-only properties. <P><H4>Editing window properties</H4>
The <I>editing window</I> class designates the windows displayed by 
editors. They have only one specific property,
<I>kind</I>, which indicates the kind of the corresponding editor (it is 
one of <I>hexadecimal</I>, <I>template</I> or <I>interface</I>).<P>For instance:
<PRE>
	set editWin to editing window 1
	get the kind of editWin<P></PRE>
This is a read-only property. <P>As a convenience, it is possible to designate <I>editing windows</I> 
directly as elements of a map document. So, as a shortcut, one can write
<PRE>
    get editing window 1 of map document 1
</PRE>
instead of 
<PRE>
    get window of editor 1 of map document 1
</PRE>
Similarly
<PRE>
    get hexadecimal window 1 of map document 1
</PRE>
is equivalent to
<PRE>
    get window of hexadecimal editor 1 of map document 1
</PRE>
The same is true when designating the editing windows by name rather than 
by index:
<PRE>
	get editing window "name_of_window" of map document 1
</PRE>
instead of 
<PRE>
	get window of editor "name_of_window" of map document 1
</PRE>
Similarly
<PRE>
	get template window "name_of_window" of map document 1
</PRE>
is equivalent to
<PRE>
	get window of template editor "name_of_window" of map document 1
</PRE><P><H4>Map properties</H4>
The resource maps are considered as objects directly contained in the 
application. They are characterized by a unique ID: this is a reference 
number attributed by the System's Resource Manager when the map is opened. 
For instance, the following instruction 
<PRE>
	get map of map document 1
</PRE>
would return something like:
<P> <I>map id 22 of application "Rezilla"</I>
<P> The map could thus be subsequently invoked in a script as <I>map id 22</I>.
The ID of a map is guaranteed to be unique.<P>Resource maps have the following properties:
<UL>
	<LI> <I>refnum</I>: the reference number of the map in memory<P>	<LI> <I>all types</I>: the list of all the types contained in this map (in alphabetical order)<P>	<LI> <I>attributes</I>: the global value of the map attributes (a numeric 
value, sum of the individual flags)<P>	<LI> <I>readOnly</I>: the map's <I>ReadOnly</I> flag (a boolean value)<P>	<LI> <I>compact</I>: the map's <I>Compact</I> flag (a boolean value)<P>	<LI> <I>changed</I>: the map's <I>Changed</I> flag (a boolean value)
</UL><P>Here is a sample script to retrieve the properties of a resource map:
<PRE>
	set theMap to the map of map document 1
	set a to the refnum of theMap
	set b to the attributes of theMap
	set c to the readOnly of theMap
	set d to the compact of theMap
	set e to the changed of theMap
	
	{a, b, c, d, e}<P></PRE>
A map is a container itself: the objects it contains are types as we will 
see in the next section. To get the list of all types (as text) within the map:
<PRE>
	set theMap to the map of map document 1
	get all types of theMap<P></PRE><P>The <I>attributes</I>, <I>readOnly</I>, <I>compact</I>, and 
<I>changed</I> properties can be modified using the <B>set</B> command. 
The others are read only properties. For instance:
<PRE>
	set theMap to map document 1
	-- 160 is mapReadOnly _and_ mapChanged (128 + 32)
	set the attributes of theMap to 160
	-- This unsets the mapReadOnly flag (-128)
	set the readOnly of theMap to 0
	-- This sets the mapCompact flag (+64)
	set the compact of theMap to 1
	-- This unsets the mapChanged flag (-32)
	set the changed of theMap to 0<P></PRE><P><H4>Type properties</H4>
A type is an object containing <I>resource</I> objects. Its elements are 
all the resources of this type. The types are elements of a map object: 
they can be designated by index or by name. The index of a type is its 
index in the list of all types belonging to its owner map. The name is the 
four-characters string representing this type (like "TEXT", "icns", 
"MENU", etc.)<P>The following properties can be obtained:
<UL>
	<LI> <I>index</I>: the index of the type in the document (types are ordered alphabetically)<P>	<LI> <I>name</I>: the type's string<P>	<LI> <I>all IDs</I>: the list of all IDs of the resources belonging to this type
</UL><P>Here is a sample script to retrieve the properties of a type in a resource map:
<PRE>
	set theType to type "TEXT" of map 1
	set a to the index of theType
	set b to the name of theType
	{a, b}<P></PRE>
To get the list of all resources within the type:
<PRE>
	set theType to type "TEXT" of map 1
	get all IDs of theType<P></PRE><P>All these properties are read only properties. They cannot be modified with
the <B>set</B> command.<P><H4>Resource properties</H4><P>A resource within a type object can be specified by index, by name or by 
ID. The specification by ID is unique. A resource can also be specified 
directly in a resource map using a pair made of its type name and its ID, 
like for instance:
<PRE>
	resource {"TEXT", 128} of map id 22
</PRE><P>Note that it is also possible to refer to a resource as if it were directly
an object of the resource map document rather than an object of this
document's map. This is a shortcut which allows to write constructs like:
<PRE>
	resource {"TEXT", 128} of theDoc
</PRE>
instead of 
<PRE>
	resource {"TEXT", 128} of the map of theDoc
</PRE><P>The various properties of a resource object can be obtained using the 
following terms:
<UL>
	<LI> <I>name</I>: the resource's name<P>	<LI> <I>typename</I>: the type of the resource as text<P>	<LI> <I>ID</I>: the ID of the resource<P>	<LI> <I>index</I>: the index of the resource within its type (in the order used by the resource manager)<P>	<LI> <I>attributes</I>: the global value of the resource's attributes (a 
numeric value, sum of the individual flags)<P>	<LI> <I>sysHeap</I>: the resource's <I>SysHeap</I> flag (a boolean value)<P>	<LI> <I>purgeable</I>: the resource's <I>Purgeable</I> flag (a boolean value)<P>	<LI> <I>locked</I>: the resource's <I>Locked</I> flag (a boolean value)<P>	<LI> <I>preload</I>: the resource's <I>Preload</I> flag (a boolean value)<P>	<LI> <I>protected</I>: the resource's <I>Protected</I> flag (a boolean value)<P>	<LI> <I>changed</I>: the resource's <I>Changed</I> flag (a boolean value)<P>	<LI> <I>size</I>: the size of the resource data (in bytes)<P>	<LI> <I>sizeOnDisc</I>: the size of the resource on disk<P>	<LI> <I>hex data</I>: the resource data (in hexadecimal format)<P></UL><P>Here is a sample script to retrieve some of these values:
<PRE>
	set therez to resource {"TEXT", 128} of map id 22
	set a to the name of therez
	set b to the ID of therez
	set c to the changed of therez
	set d to the size of therez
	set e to the sizeOnDisc of therez
	set f to the attributes of therez
	set g to the system heap of therez
	set h to the purgeable of therez
	set i to the locked of therez
	set j to the preload of therez
	set k to the protected of therez
	
	{a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k}<P></PRE><P>The <I>name</I>, <I>attributes</I>, <I>sysHeap</I>, <I>purgeable</I>, 
<I>locked</I>, <I>preload</I>, <I>protected</I>, <I>changed</I>, <I>sizeOnDisc</I>, and <I>hex data</I> properties can be modified using 
the <B>set</B> command. 
The others are read only properties. For instance:
<PRE>
	set theRez to resource {"MENU", 128} of map document 1
	set the name of theRez to "Apple menu"
	-- 12 is resProtected _and_ resPreload (8 + 4):
	set the attributes of theRez to 12
	-- This unsets the resProtected flag:
	set the protected of theRez to 0
	-- This sets the resPurgeable flag:
	set the purgeable of theRez to 1
	-- This unsets the resLocked flag:
	set the locked of theRez to 1
	-- This sets the resChanged flag:
	set the changed of theRez to 1
	-- Modifiy the size on disc (use at your own risk):
	set the sizeOnDisc of theRez to 512<P></PRE><P><H4>Resource contents</H4><P>The data of the resource can be obtained using the <I>hex data</I> property, 
like this:
<PRE>
	set theRez to resource {"ALRT", 128} of map 1
	get the hex data of theRez<P></PRE>
The result is returned in hexadecimal form, like, for instance: 
<PRE>
	"002800280096019000805555300a"
</PRE><P>The <B>set</B> command can be used to install different data in the resource. For 
instance:
<PRE>
	set theRez to resource {"ALRT", 128} of map 1
	set the hex data of therez to "001400140087016800805555300a"<P></PRE><P>Note that there are two exceptions to the hexadecimal representation of
resource data. They concern resources of type <I>TEXT</I> and resources of
type <I>STR#</I>. In that case, Rezilla will use the textual 
representation directly:
<UL>
	<LI> resources of type <I>TEXT</I> are represented by a text string
	<LI> resources of type <I>STR#</I> are represented by an AppleScript 
list of textual strings
</UL>
For instance, the command 
<PRE>
	get hex data of resource {"TEXT", 128} of map 1
</PRE>
would return <I>Viva Rezilla</I> instead of the equivalent hexadecimal 
566976612052657a696c6c61 value.<P>The opposite is true. To set the value of a <I>TEXT</I> or a <I>STR#</I>
resource, use the following syntax:
<PRE>
	-- simple string
	set txtRez to resource {"TEXT", 128} of map 1
	set the hex data of txtRez to "Viva Rezilla!!!"
	-- list of strings
	set strRez to resource {"STR#", 128} of map 1
	set the hex data of strRez to {"Viva Rezilla!!!", "Rezilla is great!!!"}<P></PRE><P>
