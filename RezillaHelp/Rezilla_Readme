Rezilla
=======

Rezilla is a resource forks editor for the Macintosh. 
This is version 1.0.7.

This new version contains:
    ¥ a string lists editor which lets you edit resources of type 'STR#', 
	  'MBAR', 'Mcmd', 'RidL'. This editor has drag and drop capacity and 
	  makes it easy to add or remove items in the lists.
	¥ a few minor fixes and, for those interested in compiling Rezilla from
	  source, I have added project files for XCode 1.5 and XCode 2.1 (Rezilla
	  is still built with CodeWarrior though).


Previous versions already implemented the following features:
    ¥ edit, create, modify, duplicate, remove resources contained in any fork
	(data fork or resource fork)
    ¥ copy, cut and paste resources from a resource map to the other
    ¥ drag and drop resources
    ¥ compare resource maps
    ¥ export resource maps to various formats (including HTML and XML)
    ¥ set properties via preferences
    ¥ template editor with more than 385 internal templates
    ¥ text editor
    ¥ menu editor
    ¥ Unicode editor to edit resources storing Unicode UTF-16 data
    ¥ bitmap editor to edit many icon types ( 'cicn', 'crsr', 'CURS',
	 'icl4', 'icl8', 'icm#', 'icm4', 'icm8', 'ICN#', 'ICON', 'ics#',
	 'ics4', 'ics8', 'PAT#', 'PAT ', 'ppat', 'SICN')
    ¥ Aete editor to edit AppleScript terminology resources (type 'aete' or 
     'aeut'). Export and import in xml, html, sdef formats.
    ¥ 'PICT' resources viewer
    ¥ 'snd ' resources player
    ¥ complete scriptability to drive Rezilla with AppleScript



The Rezilla project is a work in progress. This release is the first final
release (previous versions were in beta testing stage) and is also the last
of the 1.0.x series: next version will be 1.1 and will implement a plugin
architecture in order to support third party editors. As usual, it comes
without any warranty (see licence terms). That said, it has been thoroughly
tested and has proven quite stable and reliable.
