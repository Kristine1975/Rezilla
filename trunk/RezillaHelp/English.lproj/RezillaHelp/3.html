<H2>Resource Map Table</H2>
Upon opening a resource file, the resource map is displayed in  an  outline
table listing the various resource types contained in the file: if  you
click on the disclosure triangle at the left of the type, the table displays,
at the second level, the list of the various resources belonging to this
type, with their ID number, their size and their name (if any).<P><P><IMG SRC="../../Images/rzil_rezmaptable.gif" ALT="Resource Map Table" ALIGN=bottom></P><P><P> The bottom part of the Resource Map Table's window has indicators
showing the number of different types in this map and the total number of
resources. The letters DF or RF at the right of the number of resources
indicate if the resource map was opened from the data fork or the resource
fork of the file.<P><P> The lower left corner of the windows displays a small lock icon: if 
the lock is closed, the resource map is in read-only mode. In this mode you
can not execute any editing action: all the menu commands related to
resource map editing are disabled. You can still view the contents of a
resource using the hexadecimal editor but it will be in read-only mode too. <P><H3>Editing resources</H3><P><P> Double-clicking on a resource item in the table calls an editor for  this
resource. This is equivalent to selecting the resource item and choosing the
<I>Edit</I> command in the <I>Resource</I> menu. There are 
basically three editing modes for a particular resource type:
<UL>
	<LI> interface editing
	<LI> template-based editing
	<LI> hexadecimal editing
</UL><P>The <I>interface editing</I> implies that a custom editor is available for
this type: it usually offers a nice graphical interface which makes it easy
to edit and modify the resource without having to know anything about 
the internal structure of the resource itself. Only a few types have such
an editor. <I>Template-based editing</I> implies that a template is
available for this type: a template is an abstract description of the
format of the resource type which is used by Rezilla to build a graphical
interface. The <I>Template Editor</I> is thus also a graphical editor.
Many resource types have a well-defined structure which can be described by
a template. Rezilla knows of more than 150 templates. Furthermore you can
easily install additional templates (see the <I>Template Editor</I>
section below). Hexadecimal editing is always available: the binary data of
the resource are edited in an hexadecimal editor window: this is a sort of
low-level editing mode which lets you access and modify any byte of the
resource (see the <I>Hexadecimal Editor</I> section below).<P><P> When the <I>Edit</I> command is invoked for a particular resource, Rezilla
will first look for an interface editor for this resource. If none is
available, it will then look for a template corresponding to the resource's
type and invoke the <I>Template Editor</I>. It no template is found, the
last resort will be to call the <I>Hexadecimal Editor</I>.<P><H3>Substitution types</H3>
Certain resource types have identical structures. For instance a keyboard
small icon resource with type <I>kcs4</I> has exactly the same format as
an <I>ics4</I> small icon. These types arre thus interchangeable and can
be edited using the same editor or the same template as the other. Rezilla
knows of a certain number of such situations and automatically makes the
substitution: for instance, it will not find an interface or a template
editor for <I>itl0</I> resources but will use the <I>INTL</I> template
instead.<P><P> You can force Rezilla to use a particular substitution type by using
the <I>Save as type...</I> menu item in the <I>Resource</I> menu. It
displays a small dialog in which you select the substitution type from a
menu or type it directly in a field.<P><H3>Modifier keys</H3>
<P> When double-clicking on a resource in the resource map table, one can also
use a modifier key:
<UL>
	<LI> if the shift key is pressed while double-clicking, the <I>Template
Editor</I> is called directly. If no template is available, then the 
<I>Hexadecimal Editor</I> is called instead.
	<LI> if the option key is pressed while double-clicking, the 
<I>Hexadecimal Editor</I> is called directly.
</UL><P><P> Several resources can be selected simultaneously in the 
table in order to edit them.<P><P> Control-clicking (single click) on a resource item in the table calls the 
<I>Inspector window</I> for this resource. This is equivalent to selecting
the resource item and choosing the <I>Get Info</I> command in the 
<I>Resource</I> menu. See the <I>Inspector window</I> section below.<P><P> Note that clicking on a disclosure triangle with  the  option-key  down
will act upon all the resource types: if the triangle  was  in  the  closed
state, all resource types will be opened, if it was in  the  opened  state,
then all the resource types will be closed.<P>
